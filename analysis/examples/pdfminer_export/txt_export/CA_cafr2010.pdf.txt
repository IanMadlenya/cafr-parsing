March 18, 2011

To the Citizens, Governor, and Members
of the Legislature of the State of California:

I am pleased to submit the State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the
year ended June 30, 2010. This report meets the requirements of Government Code section 12460 for an
annual report prepared strictly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) and contains information to help readers gain a reasonable understanding of
the State’s financial activities.
 
California, like the nation, is slowly recovering from the past two years of fiscal crisis and is struggling to
reach financial stability. However, though the State’s “bottomline” (primary government net assets) does
not yet reflect it, there is some evidence that California’s downward trend has stopped and its financial
position is improving. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the State’s expenses exceeded revenues
by  $11.2 billion  for  governmental  activities,  a  $6.7  billion  improvement  from  last  year’s  $17.9 billion
shortfall.  Governmental  activities  include  most  services  and  expenses  normally  associated  with  state
government,  such  as  health  and  human  services,  education,  business  and  transportation,  correctional
programs, and general government. The State’s three major sources of revenue—personal income taxes,
corporation taxes, and sales and use taxes—remained stable, declining only 0.7%, from $87.7 billion in
the  2008-09  fiscal  year  to  $87.1  billion  in  the  2009-10  fiscal  year.  An  increase  in  sales  and  use  tax
receipts helped offset decreases in personal income and corporation tax revenues. From July 2 through
September  4,  2009,  the  State  issued  $2.6  billion  in  registered  warrant  payments  (449,000  warrants)
costing  taxpayers  over  $11  million.  The  State’s  General  Fund  ended  the  2009-10  fiscal  year  with  a
$9.9 billion  cash  deficit  that  was  covered  by  internal  borrowing  from  special  funds;  this  is  down
$2.0 billion from the $11.9 billion cash deficit at the end of the 2008-09 fiscal year.

improvement 

in  California’s 

fiscal  outlook.  Specifically, 

indicators  show  continued 

in
Recent 
January 2011,  the  State’s  year-to-date  revenue  from  its  three  largest  revenue  sources  was  more  than
estimated and $5.2 billion more than the amount received by the end of January 2010. Additionally, while
California’s unemployment rate was 12.5% in December 2010, there is evidence of employment growth
and increases in personal income. Although California’s economy is showing modest signs of recovery,
the State still faces budgetary and cash shortfalls in the current and following fiscal years that cannot be
solved by a slowly rebounding economy. In the short-term, the State needs budget tactics that focus on
multiyear results and ongoing solutions that include bold proposals to steadily address structural budget
issues. The State must also plan for the diminishing contributions of funding provided by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. In addition, the State must develop consistent funding
strategies  that  will  reduce  its  long-term  obligations  such  as  those  for  infrastructure,  retirement,  and
budgetary  borrowing.  Ultimately,  the  State  must  stay  focused  on  attaining  long-term  fiscal  stability  that
allows its citizens to receive the core government services they deserve in exchange for their investment
in California.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Introduction to the Report

Responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness,  and  fairness  of  data  presented  in  the  CAFR,  including  all
disclosures, rests with the State. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the enclosed data are accurate in all
material respects and are reported in a manner that fairly presents the financial position and the operations of
the primary government and its component units.

State statutes require an annual audit of the basic financial statements of the State. To meet this requirement,
the State Auditor has examined the accompanying financial statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  and  Government  Auditing  Standards  issued  by  the
Comptroller  General  of  the  United  States.  The  auditor’s  report  on  the  basic  financial  statements  and  the
combining and individual fund statements and schedules is included in the CAFR.

The State of California is also required to undergo an annual single audit in conformity with the provisions of
the  United  States  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s  (OMB)  Circular  A-133,  Audits  of  States,  Local
Governments,  and  Non-Profit  Organizations.  In  conducting  the  engagement,  the  State  Auditor  used  auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards issued by
the Comptroller General of the United States. Information related to this single audit—including a schedule of
federal assistance, the independent auditor’s report on compliance with requirements applicable to each major
program and on internal controls over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, and a schedule of
findings and questioned costs—is included in a separately issued report.

The CAFR contains three sections: Introductory, Financial, and Statistical. The Introductory Section is designed
to provide the background and context that readers need to benefit fully from the information presented in the
Financial Section. The Financial Section contains the independent auditor’s report, management’s discussion
and  analysis,  the  basic  financial  statements,  the  required  supplementary  information,  the  combining  and
individual  fund  statements,  and  the  budgetary  comparison  schedule  for  nonmajor  governmental  cost  funds.
The Statistical Section provides a history of selected financial and demographic information.

The  State’s  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (MD&A)  immediately  follows  the  independent  auditor’s
report and contains an introduction, overview, and analysis of the financial statements. Our MD&A provides a
narrative introduction to the detailed financial statements and notes contained in the CAFR.

Profile of the Government

Reporting Entity 

The  financial  reporting  entity  of  the  State  includes  all  of  the  funds  of  the  primary  government  and  of  its
component units. Component units are legally separate entities for which the primary government is financially
accountable.  Blended  component  units,  although  legally  separate  entities,  are,  in  substance,  part  of  the
primary government’s operations and are included as part of the primary government. Accordingly, the building
authorities  are  reported  in  the  capital  projects  funds  of  the  primary  government.  The  lease  agreements
between the building authorities and the primary government, amounting to $427 million, have been eliminated
from  the  balance  sheet.  Instead,  only  the  underlying  capital  assets  and  the  debt  used  to  acquire  them  are
reported in the government-wide statements. The Golden State Tobacco Securitization Corporation is reported
as a special revenue fund of the primary government. 

iv

California State Controller’s Transmittal Letter

Discretely presented component units are reported separately in the government-wide financial statements to
emphasize  that  they  are  legally  separate  from  the  primary  government  and  to  differentiate  their  financial
position  and  results  of  operations  from  those  of  the  primary  government.  Additional  information  on  the
reporting entity is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Budgetary Controls

The State Legislature prepares an annual budget that contains estimates of revenues and expenditures for the
ensuing  fiscal  year.  This  budget  is  the  result  of  negotiations  between  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature.
Throughout  the  fiscal  year,  adjustments,  in  the  form  of  budget  revisions,  executive  orders,  and  financial
legislation  agreed  to  by  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature  are  made  to  the  budget.  The  State  Controller  is
statutorily  responsible  for  control  over  revenues  due  the  primary  government  and  for  expenditures  of  each
appropriation contained in the budget. Budgeted appropriations are the expenditure authorizations that allow
state agencies to purchase or create liabilities for goods and services. 

The State’s accounting system provides the State Controller’s Office with a centrally-controlled record system
to fully account for each budgeted appropriation, including its unexpended balance, and for all cash receipts
and  disbursements. The  accounting  system  is  decentralized,  meaning  the  detail  of  each  control  account  is
maintained  by  each  state  agency.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  control  accounts  and  the  agency  accounts  are
maintained and reconciled on a cash basis. At the end of the fiscal year, each agency prepares annual accrual
reports for receivables and payables. The State Controller’s Office combines its control account balances with
the agency accrual reports to prepare California’s Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report and the Budgetary/
Legal Basis Annual Report Supplement. State laws and regulations that, in some cases, do not fully agree with
GAAP govern the methods of accounting for expenditures and revenues in these reports. 

The information in the CAFR represents a consolidation of the amounts in the Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual
Report and adjustments to the account balances to conform to GAAP. Additional information on the budgetary
basis  of  accounting  can  be  found  in  Note  2,  Budgetary  and  Legal  Compliance,  and  in  the  Required
Supplementary Information section that follows the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Internal Controls

An internal control structure has been designed to ensure that the assets of the government are protected from
loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  legal  requirements  and  GAAP.  The  internal  control  structure  is
designed  to  provide  reasonable,  but  not  absolute,  assurance  that  these  objectives  are  met. The  concept  of
reasonable  assurance  recognizes  that:  (1)  the  cost  of  a  control  should  not  exceed  the  benefits  likely  to  be
derived,  and  (2)  the  valuation  of  costs  and  benefits  requires  estimates  and  judgments  by  management.  In
addition, the government maintains extensive budgetary controls. The objective of these controls is to ensure
compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by the Legislature and
Governor.

Financial Condition

Economic Outlook

The  last  two  years  have  been  challenging  for  the  nation  and  California.  While  recent  economic  conditions
show  that  a  slow  recovery  is  underway,  conditions  remain  difficult  for  businesses  and  residents  across  the
state.  Labor  markets  have  grown  more  slowly  than  most  Californians  had  hoped.  Housing,  while  stabilizing,
still has issues to work through in the mortgage markets. The weak housing markets and the depressed level
of home building will continue to slow the economic recovery. These factors are likely to depress consumer
confidence  and,  therefore,  the  willingness  and  ability  of  individuals  and  firms  to  spend  and  invest  for  some
time.  The  economy  may  have  turned  the  corner,  but  it  will  take  several  years  of  sustained  growth  before
California returns to its pre-recession peak of activity.

The  Legislative  Analyst’s  Office  (LAO),  California’s  nonpartisan  fiscal  and  policy  advisor,  estimates  that
California’s personal income will grow by 5.0% in 2011 and 3.3% in 2012. The LAO forecasts that the State’s
three  major  sources  of  revenue—personal  income  taxes,  corporation  taxes,  and  sales  and  use  taxes—will
increase  by  5.6%  in  the  2010-11  fiscal  year  and,  after  a  decrease  of  1.4%  in  the  2011-12  fiscal  year  as
temporary  tax  increases  expire,  will  continue  to  increase.  However,  there  is  much  uncertainty  in  these
forecasts. The LAO also estimates that California’s employment will grow 0.9% in 2011 and 2.2% in 2012 and
2013, but that the unemployment rate will remain above 7% through 2015.

Budget Outlook

2010-11 Fiscal Year

California’s 2010-11 Budget Act was enacted on October 8, 2010, 100 days after the fiscal year began. The
budget  included  $19.3  billion  in  solutions  to  what  was  then-estimated  to  be  a  $17.9  billion  General  Fund
budget shortfall. The solutions included expenditure reductions; new federal funding; revenue actions; and one-
time  loans,  transfers,  and  funding  shifts.  However,  revised  estimates  show  that  significantly  less  revenue  is
expected from the federal government and other sources and the State will not be able to achieve the desired
results  from  all  of  its  other  planned  budget  solutions.  The  proposed  2011-12  Governor’s  Budget  includes
revenue  actions  and  other  solutions  that  could  significantly  reduce  the  now-projected  $8.2  billion  gap  at  the
end of the 2010-11 fiscal year, but they would require timely legislative and voter action.

2011-12 Fiscal Year

The Governor released his proposed 2011-12 budget on January 10, 2011. This proposed budget projects a
$25.4 billion gap between estimated revenues and state expenditures over the next 18 months. The Governor’s
Budget proposes $12.5 billion in expenditure-related solutions, $12.0 billion in new revenues, and $1.9 billion in
internal  borrowing  from  special  funds  and  other  sources. The  2011-12  Governor’s  Budget  projects  (with  all
budget  solutions  enacted)  General  Fund  revenues  and  transfers  of  $89.7  billion  and  expenditures  of
$84.6 billion, resulting in a $1 billion reserve. The majority of the budget actions are not one-time solutions, but
are intended to last beyond the 2011-12 fiscal year. Two significant and interrelated elements are included in
the  Governor’s  plan:  the  extension  of  the  four  temporary  tax  increases  adopted  in  February  2009  and  the
realignment  of  state  and  local  program  responsibilities,  including  the  elimination  of  redevelopment  agencies.
However,  to  achieve  the  proposed  results,  the  Governor’s  plan  relies  on  legislative  approval  of  statutory
changes in March 2011 and voter approval of almost all of the $12.0 billion revenue solutions in a June 2011
special election.

Awards and Acknowledgments

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate
of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the State of California for its comprehensive annual
financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a
government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report.
This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.

A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. We believe that our current comprehensive
annual financial report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements and we are
submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.

This  CAFR  could  not  have  been  prepared  without  the  assistance  and  cooperation  of  all  state  agencies  and
universities.  We  wish  to  thank  the  State  Auditor  and  her  staff  for  their  audit  of  the  financial  statements
contained  in  this  report.  I  also  am  grateful  to  the  members  of  my  staff  for  their  dedicated  efforts  and
professionalism.

Sincerely,

Original signed by:

JOHN CHIANG
California State Controller

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

The  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  a  required  supplement  to  the  State  of  California’s
financial statements. It describes and analyzes the financial position of the State, providing an overview of the
State’s  activities  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010.  We  encourage  readers  to  consider  the  information  we
present here in conjunction with the information presented in the Controller’s letter of transmittal at the front of
this report and in the State’s financial statements and notes, which follow this section.

Financial Highlights – Primary Government

Government-wide Highlights

During  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,  California  showed  some  signs  of  fiscal  recovery,  but  it  continued  to  struggle
financially  as  a  result  of  the  recent  recession.  The  State’s  general  revenues  decreased  only  0.7%  from  last
year;  however,  they  were  $15.3 billion  lower  than  the  amount  received  in  the  2007-08  fiscal  year.  Although
expenses  for  the  State’s  governmental  activities  decreased  slightly  from  the  prior  year,  they  exceeded  the
amount of revenue received and caused a corresponding $11.2 billion decrease in governmental activities’ net
assets. Total expenses for the State’s business-type activities also exceeded revenues for the year, primarily
because  unemployment  benefits  paid  exceeded  employers’  contributions  and  federal  subsidies.  Reduced
general revenues, expenses that exceed revenues, and increased long-term obligations resulted in a 143.4%
decrease in the total net assets for governmental and business-type activities from the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Net Assets — The primary government’s net assets as of June 30, 2010, were a negative $4.9 billion. After the
total  net  assets  are  reduced  by  $84.2 billion  for  investment  in  capital  assets  (net  of  related  debt)  and  by
$18.4 billion  for  restricted  net  assets,  the  resulting  unrestricted  net  assets  totaled  a  negative  $107.5  billion.
Restricted net assets are dedicated for specified uses and are not available to fund current activities. Almost
two-thirds  of  the  negative  $107.5  billion  consists  of  $60.6  billion  in  outstanding  bonded  debt  issued  to  build
capital  assets  for  school  districts  and  other  local  governmental  entities.  The  bonded  debt  reduces  the
unrestricted net assets; however, local governments, not the State, record the capital assets that would offset
this reduction.

Changes  in  Net  Assets  —  The  primary  government’s  total  net  assets  decreased  by  $16.4  billion  (143.4%)
during  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010.  Net  assets  of  governmental  activities  decreased  by  $11.2  billion
(160.2%), while net assets of business-type activities decreased by $5.2 billion (117.0%).

Fund Highlights

Governmental  Funds  —  As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  primary  government’s  governmental  funds  reported  a
combined ending fund balance of $13.8 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion from the prior fiscal year. After the
total  fund  balance  is  reduced  by  $42.4  billion  in  reserves,  the  unreserved  fund  balance  totaled  a  negative
$28.6 billion.

Proprietary  Funds  —  As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  primary  government’s  proprietary  funds  reported  combined
ending net assets of a negative $227 million, a decrease of $5.0 billion from the prior fiscal year. After the total
net assets are reduced by $252 million for investment in capital assets (net of related debt) and expendable
restrictions of $3.4 billion, the unrestricted net assets totaled a negative $3.9 billion.

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities

As of June 30, 2010, the primary government’s noncurrent assets totaled $132.1 billion, of which $105.6 billion
is related to capital assets. State highway infrastructure assets of $60.1 billion represent the largest portion of
the State’s capital assets.

The primary government’s noncurrent liabilities totaled $149.4 billion, which consists of $76.6 billion in general
obligation bonds, $30.8 billion in revenue bonds, and $42.0 billion in all other noncurrent liabilities. During the
2009-10 fiscal year, the primary government’s noncurrent liabilities increased by $23.8 billion (19.0%) over the
prior fiscal year. This large increase was primarily the result of $11.8 billion in new general obligation bonds
issued  primarily  for  public  education  facilities,  transportation  projects,  housing  and  emergency  shelters,  and
various water and flood control projects; a $5.3 billion increase in the unemployment programs’ loan payable to
the U.S. Department of Labor; and a $2.6 billion increase in net other postemployment benefits obligations.

Overview of the Financial Statements

This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the section presenting the State’s basic financial statements,
which  includes  four  components:  (1) government-wide  financial  statements,  (2)  fund  financial  statements,
(3) discretely presented component units financial statements, and (4) notes to the financial statements. This
report also contains required supplementary information and combining financial statements and schedules.

Government-wide Financial Statements

Government-wide  financial  statements  are  designed  to  provide  readers  with  a  broad  overview  of  the  State’s
finances.  The  government-wide  financial  statements  do  not  include  fiduciary  programs  and  activities  of  the
primary  government  and  component  units  because  fiduciary  resources  are  not  available  to  support  state
programs.

To help readers assess the State’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year, the statements provide
both short-term and long-term information about the State’s financial position. These statements are prepared
using  the  economic  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  similar  to  methods
used by most businesses. These statements take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the
fiscal year, regardless of when the State received or paid the cash. The government-wide financial statements
include two statements: the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

The  Statement  of  Net  Assets  presents  all  of  the  State’s  assets  and  liabilities  and  reports  the  difference
between  the  two  as  net  assets.  Over  time,  increases  or  decreases  in  net  assets  indicate  whether  the
financial position of the State is improving or deteriorating.

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State’s net assets changed during the
most recent fiscal year. The State reports changes in net assets as soon as the event giving rise to the
change occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, this statement reports revenues
and expenses for some items that will result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes
and  earned  but  unused  vacation  leave).  This  statement  also  presents  a  comparison  between  direct
expenses and program revenues for each function of the State.

The government-wide financial statements separate into different columns the three types of state programs
and activities: governmental activities, business-type activities, and component units.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

(cid:129)

Governmental activities are mostly supported by taxes, such as personal income and sales and use taxes,
and  intergovernmental  revenues,  primarily  federal  grants.  Most  services  and  expenses  normally
associated  with  state  government  fall  into  this  activity  category,  including  health  and  human  services,
education  (public  kindergarten  through  12th  grade  [K-12]  schools  and  institutions  of  higher  education),
business and transportation, correctional programs, general government, resources, state and consumer
services, and interest on long-term debt.

Business-type  activities  typically  recover  all  or  a  significant  portion  of  their  costs  through  user  fees  and
charges  to  external  users  of  goods  and  services.  The  business-type  activities  of  the  State  of  California
include  providing  unemployment  insurance  programs,  providing  housing  loans  to  California  veterans,
providing  water  to  local  water  districts,  providing  building  aid  to  school  districts,  providing  services  to
California  State  University  students,  leasing  public  assets,  selling  California  State  Lottery  tickets,  and
selling  electric  power.  These  activities  are  carried  out  with  minimal  financial  assistance  from  the
governmental activities or general revenues of the State.

Component  units  are  organizations  that  are  legally  separate  from  the  State,  but  are  at  the  same  time
related  to  the  State  financially  (i.e.,  the  State  is  financially  accountable  for  them)  or  the  nature  of  their
relationship with the State is so significant that their exclusion would cause the State’s financial statements
to  be  misleading  or  incomplete.  The  State’s  financial  statements  include  the  information  for  blended,
fiduciary, and discretely presented component units.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Blended component units, although legally separate entities, are in substance a part of the primary
government’s  operations.  Therefore,  for  reporting  purposes,  the  State  integrates  data  from  blended
component  units  into  the  appropriate  funds.  The  Golden  State  Tobacco  Securitization  Corporation
and  certain  building  authorities  that  are  blended  component  units  of  the  State  are  included  in  the
governmental activities. 

Fiduciary component units are legally separate from the primary government but, due to their fiduciary
nature, are included with the primary government’s fiduciary funds. The Public Employees’ Retirement
System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System are fiduciary component units that are included
with  the  State’s  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds,  which  are  not  included  in  the
government-wide financial statements.

Discretely presented component units are legally separate from the primary government and provide
services  to  entities  and  individuals  outside  the  primary  government.  The  activities  of  discretely
presented  component  units  are  presented  in  a  single  column  in  the  government-wide  financial
statements.

Information on how to obtain financial statements of the individual component units is available from the State
Controller’s  Office,  Division  of  Accounting  and  Reporting,  P.O.  Box  942850,  Sacramento,  California  94250-
5872. 

Fund Financial Statements

Fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar
component units, and discretely presented component units. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is
used  to  maintain  control  over  resources  that  have  been  segregated  for  specific  activities  or  objectives.  The
State of California, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate
compliance with finance-related legal and contractual requirements. Following are general descriptions of the
three types of funds.

in 

the  government-wide 

Governmental  funds  are  used  to  account  for  essentially  the  same  functions  that  are  reported  as
governmental  activities 
the
government-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on short-term inflows
and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end
of  the  fiscal  year.  Such  information  may  be  useful  in  evaluating  a  government’s  short-term  financing
requirements. This approach is known as the flow of current financial resources measurement focus and
the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  These  governmental  fund  statements  provide  a  detailed
short-term  view  of  the  State’s  finances,  enabling  readers  to  determine  whether  adequate  financial
resources exist to meet the State’s current needs.

financial  statements.  However,  unlike 

Because  governmental  fund  financial  statements  provide  a  narrower  focus  than  do  government-wide
financial statements, it is useful to compare governmental fund statements to the governmental activities
information  presented  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.  By  doing  so,  readers  may  better
understand  the  long-term  impact  of  the  government’s  short-term  financing  decisions.  Reconciliations
located  on  the  pages  immediately  following  the  fund  statements  show  the  differences  between  the
government-wide  statements  and  the  governmental  fund  Balance  Sheet  and  the  governmental  fund
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances. Primary differences between the
government-wide  and  fund  statements  relate  to  noncurrent  assets,  such  as  land  and  buildings,  and
noncurrent  liabilities,  such  as  bonded  debt  and  amounts  owed  for  compensated  absences  and  capital
lease  obligations,  which  are  reported  in  the  government-wide  statements  but  not  in  the  fund-based
statements.

(cid:129)

Proprietary  funds  show  activities  that  operate  more  like  those  found  in  the  private  sector.  The  State  of
California has two proprietary fund types: enterprise funds and internal service funds.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Enterprise funds record activities for which a fee is charged to external users; they are presented as
business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements.

Internal service funds accumulate and allocate costs internally among the State of California’s various
functions.  For  example,  internal  service  funds  provide  information  technology,  printing,  fleet
management, and architectural services primarily for state departments. As a result, their activity is
considered governmental.

(cid:129)

Fiduciary funds account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the State. Fiduciary funds and
the  activities  of  fiduciary  component  units  are  not  reflected  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements
because  the  resources  of  these  funds  are  not  available  to  support  State  of  California  programs.  The
accounting  used  for  fiduciary  funds  and  similar  component  units  is  similar  to  that  used  for  proprietary
funds.

Discretely Presented Component Units Financial Statements

As discussed previously, the State has financial accountability for discretely presented component units, which
have certain independent qualities and operate in a similar manner as private-sector businesses. The activities
of the discretely presented component units are classified as enterprise activities.

Notes to the Financial Statements

The notes to the financial statements in this publication provide additional information that is essential for a full
understanding  of  the  data  provided  in  the  government-wide  and  fund  financial  statements.  The  notes  to  the
financial statements, which describe particular accounts in more detail, are located immediately following the
discretely presented component units’ financial statements.

Required Supplementary Information

A  section  of  required  supplementary  information  follows  the  notes  to  the  basic  financial  statements  in  this
publication.  This  section 
for  certain  pension  and  other
postemployment  benefit  trust  funds,  information  on  infrastructure  assets  based  on  the  modified  approach,  a

Combining Financial Statements and Schedules

The Combining Financial Statements and Schedules – Nonmajor and Other Funds section presents combining
statements that provide separate financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor proprietary
funds, fiduciary funds, and nonmajor component units. The basic financial statements present only summary
information for these activities.

Government-wide Financial Analysis

Net Assets

The  primary  government’s  combined  net  assets  (governmental  and  business-type  activities)  decreased
143.4%, from $11.4 billion as restated at June 30, 2009, to a negative $4.9 billion a year later.

The  primary  government’s  $84.2  billion  investment  in  capital  assets,  such  as  land,  building,  equipment,  and
infrastructure (roads, bridges, and other immovable assets) comprise a significant portion of its net assets. This
amount of capital assets is net of any outstanding debt used to acquire those assets. The State uses capital
assets when providing services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.
Although the State’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, the resources needed to repay
this debt must come from other sources because the State cannot use the capital assets themselves to pay off
the liabilities.

Another $18.4 billion of the primary government’s net assets represents resources that are externally restricted
as  to  how  they  may  be  used,  such  as  resources  pledged  to  debt  service.  Internally  imposed  earmarking  of
resources is not presented in this publication as restricted net assets. The State may use a positive balance of
unrestricted net assets of governmental activities to meet its ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. As of
June  30,  2010,  governmental  activities  showed  an  unrestricted  net  assets  deficit  of  $103.3 billion  and
business-type activities showed an unrestricted net assets deficit of $4.3 billion.

A  large  portion  of  the  negative  unrestricted  net  assets  of  governmental  activities  consists  of  $60.6 billion  in
outstanding  bonded  debt  issued  to  build  capital  assets  for  school  districts  and  other  local  governmental
entities. Because the State does not own these capital assets, neither the assets nor the related bonded debt
is included in the portion of net assets reported as “investment in capital assets, net of related debt.” Instead,
the bonded debt is reported as a non-current liability that reduces the State’s unrestricted net assets. Readers

can expect to see a continued deficit in unrestricted net assets of governmental activities as long as the State
has significant outstanding obligations for school districts and other local governmental entities.

The  expenses  of  the  primary  government  totaled  $230.0 billion  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010.  Of  this
amount, $118.8 billion (51.6%) was funded with program revenues (charges for services or program-specific
grants  and  contributions),  leaving  $111.2 billion  to  be  funded  with  general  revenues  (mainly  taxes).  The
primary government’s general revenues of $94.9 billion were less than the unfunded expenses. As a result, the
total net assets decreased by $16.4 billion, or 143.4%.

Of  the  total  decrease,  net  assets  for  governmental  activities  decreased  by  $11.2 billion,  while  those  for
business-type  activities  decreased  by  $5.2 billion.  The  decrease  in  governmental  activities’  net  assets  is
primarily due to reduced general revenue—primarily revenue from personal income and corporation taxes as a
result of the economic downturn that California and the nation experienced during the last two years—without a
corresponding  reduction  in  state  expenses.  Since  the  2007-08  fiscal  year,  general  revenue  decreased  by
$15.3 billion while governmental activities’ expenses increased by $2.8 billion. The decrease in business-type
activities’  net  assets  is  mainly  due  to  unemployment  benefit  payments  exceeding  employers’  contributions,
federal subsidies, and other revenue for unemployment programs.

Expenses

 
For the year ended June 30, 2010, total state tax revenues collected for governmental activities decreased by
0.5% from the prior year. Sales and use taxes increased by $2.5 billion (8.1%), but the decreases in personal
income  taxes  ($1.8 billion,  or  4.0%)  and  corporation  taxes  ($1.3  billion,  or  11.8%)  substantially  offset  that
increase. The increase in sales and use taxes was the result of a temporary 1% increase in the State’s tax
rate. Personal income and corporation tax revenues declined because of California’s weakened economy and
high unemployment rate.

Overall expenses for governmental activities decreased by $1.7 billion (0.9%) from the prior year. The largest
decrease  in  expenses  was  a  $3.9 billion  decrease  in  education  spending  that  was  attributable  to  program
reductions;  increased  class  sizes;  and  a  decline  in  the  Proposition  98  funding  requirement  (known  as  the
minimum  education  funding  guarantee),  which  allowed  the  State  to  reduce  General  Fund  spending  on  K-14
education.  This  decrease  was  somewhat  offset  by  increased  spending  in  health  and  human  services  and
business and transportation.

Business-type activities expenses totaled $39.4 billion. Program revenues of $20.8 billion, primarily generated
from charges for services, and $13.4 billion in transfers, primarily from the Federal Fund, were not sufficient to
cover  these  expenses.  Consequently,  business-type  activities’  total  net  assets  decreased  by  $5.2  billion,  or
117.0%, during the year ended June 30, 2010. Most of the decrease was due to a $5.1 billion decrease in the
unemployment  programs’  net  assets,  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  Fund  Financial  Analysis  section  under
Proprietary Funds.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Fund Financial Analysis

The national recession and the State’s weakened economy had the greatest impact on governmental funds,
which  rely  heavily  on  taxes  to  support  the  majority  of  their  services  and  programs.  However,  with  federal
economic stimulus funding, expenditure reductions, the issuance of general obligation bonds, and loans from
other governments, the State’s governmental funds had a $3.8 billion increase in fund balance over the prior
year’s  restated  ending  fund  balance.  Most  of  the  proprietary  funds  incurred  net  asset  reductions,  as  their
expenses exceeded revenues for the year ended June 30, 2010. The Unemployment Programs Fund incurred
the  largest  decline  in  its  net  assets  due  to  increased  benefit  payments  in  response  to  California’s  high
unemployment rate.

Governmental Funds

The  governmental  funds’  Balance  Sheet  reported  $68.9 billion  in  assets,  $55.2 billion  in  liabilities,  and
$13.8 billion in fund balance as of June 30, 2010. Total assets of governmental funds increased by 8.3%, while
total liabilities increased by only 0.1%, resulting in a total fund balance increase of $3.8 billion (37.8%) over the
prior fiscal year. The increase in assets and fund balance was mainly due to unused general obligation bond
proceeds  remaining  at  year-end  in  the  cash  and  pooled  investments  accounts  of  nonmajor  governmental
funds. As in the prior year, the General Fund had to rely heavily on internal borrowing from the State’s other
funds  to  meet  its  payment  obligations.  However,  by  June  30,  2010,  the  total  internal  loan  balance  had
decreased by $2.0 billion to $9.9 billion.

Within the governmental funds’ total fund balance, $42.4 billion has been set aside in reserves. The reserved
amounts are not available for new spending because they have been committed for outstanding contracts and
purchase orders ($7.5 billion), noncurrent interfund receivables and loans receivable ($12.3 billion), continuing
appropriations  ($22.1 billion),  and  debt  service  ($549  million).  The  reserve  for  continuing  appropriations
increased by $13.6 billion primarily for amounts appropriated to enhance hospital quality and health care for
children. These expenditures will be funded through future federal grants and fees charged to hospitals. The
unreserved balance of the governmental funds is a negative $28.6 billion.

The Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of the governmental funds shows
$192.9 billion in revenues, $190.7 billion in expenditures, and a net $1.7 billion in receipts from other financing
sources.  The  ending  fund  balance  of  the  governmental  funds  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010  was
$13.8 billion, a $3.8 billion increase over the prior year’s restated ending fund balance of $10.0 billion. A large
reason for the increase in the fund balance was caused by a net increase in intergovernmental revenue in the
Federal  Fund  as  a  result  of  economic  stimulus  funds  received  from  the  federal  American  Recovery  and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. A majority of this revenue was transferred to the Unemployment Programs
Fund, a major enterprise fund, so the resulting net increase to governmental fund revenue was $4.8 billion—an
$18.1  billion  increase  in  intergovernmental  revenue  less  the  $13.3  billion  transfer  to  the  Unemployment
Programs Fund.

Personal  income  taxes,  which  account  for  46.4%  of  tax  revenues  and  22.8%  of  total  governmental  fund
revenues, decreased by $1.6 billion from the prior fiscal year. Sales and use taxes, which account for 35.7% of
tax  revenues  and  17.5%  of  total  governmental  fund  revenues,  increased  by  $2.3 billion  over  the  prior  fiscal
year.  Corporation  taxes,  which  account  for  10.0%  of  tax  revenues  and  4.9%  of  total  governmental  fund
revenues, decreased by $1.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. Governmental fund expenditures decreased by
$5.2 billion  from  the  prior  fiscal  year,  primarily  in  education  programs.  General  obligation  bonds  and
commercial  paper  of  $12.0 billion  were  issued  during  the  2009-10  fiscal  year;  however,  this  was  $4.7 billion
less than the amount issued in the prior fiscal year.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

The State’s major governmental funds are the General Fund, the Federal Fund, and the Transportation Fund.
The  General  Fund  ended  the  fiscal  year  with  a  fund  deficit  of  $19.6  billion.  The  Federal  Fund  and  the
Transportation Fund ended the fiscal year with fund balances of $90 million and $7.0 billion, respectively. The
nonmajor governmental funds ended the year with a total fund balance of $26.3 billion.

General Fund: As shown on the Balance Sheet, the General Fund (the State’s main operating fund) ended the
fiscal  year  with  assets  of  $12.9  billion,  liabilities  of  $32.5  billion,  and  fund  balance  reserves  of  $1.3  billion,
leaving  the  General  Fund  with  an  unreserved  fund  deficit  of  $20.9  billion.  Total  assets  of  the  General  Fund
decreased by $1.8 billion from the prior fiscal year, mainly because of a $1.1 billion decrease in amounts due
from other funds. During the 2009-10 fiscal year, the General Fund continued to experience cash shortages
and  relied  on  internal  borrowing  from  the  State’s  other  funds  to  meet  its  payment  obligations.  However,  by
June 30, 2010, the total amount borrowed from other funds had decreased by $2.0 billion to $9.9 billion. Even
with this decrease in short- and long-term interfund payables, the liabilities of the General Fund increased by
$1.7 billion (5.6%), mainly as a result of increased tax overpayments from various tax amnesty programs.

As shown on the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of the governmental
funds,  the  General  Fund  had  $85.1  billion  in  revenues,  $87.2  billion  in  expenditures,  and  a  net  $1.4 billion
disbursement from other financing sources (uses) for the year ended June 30, 2010. Approximately 93.3% of
General  Fund  revenue  ($79.4  billion)  is  derived  from  the  State’s  big  three  taxes—personal  income  taxes
($43.1 billion), sales and use taxes ($26.9 billion), and corporation taxes ($9.4 billion).

During  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,  total  General  Fund  revenue  increased  by  a  modest  $926  million,  or  1.1%.
Revenue from personal income taxes and corporation taxes decreased by $1.6 billion (3.6%) and $1.3 billion
(11.8%),  respectively.  These  decreases  were  primarily  caused  by  California’s  weakened  economy  and  high
unemployment rate. Revenue from sales and use taxes increased by $3.1 billion (13.0%), due to a temporary
1% increase in the sales tax rate effective April 2009 through June 2011. Revenue from licenses and permits
increased  by  $1.2 billion  as  a  result  of  a  temporary  increase  in  the  assessment  rate  for  vehicle  license  fees
effective  May  2009  through  June  2011.  The  General  Fund’s  other  financing  sources  increased  because  the
State exercised its borrowing authority under Proposition 1A of 2004 and received $2.0 billion of property tax
revenues from local agencies. The borrowed sums must be repaid with interest by the end of June 2013.

General  Fund  expenditures  decreased  by  $5.4  billion,  to  $87.2  billion.  The  programs  with  the  largest
decreases were health and human services, which decreased by $3.9 billion, to $24.1 billion, and education,
which decreased by $1.8 billion, to $44.2 billion. The General Fund’s ending fund balance (including reserves)
for the year ended June 30, 2010, was a negative $19.6 billion, a decrease of $3.5 billion from the prior year’s
ending  fund  balance  of  negative  $16.1  billion.  The  decreased  expenditures  for  health  and  human  services
were  mainly  the  result  of  economic  relief,  provided  by  ARRA,  that  reduced  the  General  Fund’s  share  of
Medical  Assistance  program  costs  and  increased  the  required  federal  share.  Lower  General  Fund  revenues
resulted  in  a  decline  in  the  Proposition  98  funding  requirement  (known  as  the  minimum  education  funding
guarantee), which allowed the State to reduce General Fund spending on K-14 education in the 2009-10 fiscal
year.  Program  reductions  and  increased  class  sizes  also  contributed  to  the  decrease  in  education
expenditures. 

Federal  Fund:  This  fund  reports  federal  grant  revenues  and  the  related  expenditures  to  support  the  grant
programs. The largest of these program areas is health and human services, which accounted for $46.3 billion
(75.0%)  of  the  total  $61.7  billion  in  fund  expenditures.  The  Medical  Assistance  program  and  the  Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families program are included in this program area. Education programs also constituted
a large part of the fund’s expenditures—$10.4 billion (16.8%)—most of which were apportionments made to
local  educational  agencies  (school  districts,  county  offices  of  education,  community  colleges).  The  Federal
Fund’s  revenues  increased  by  approximately  the  same  amount  as  its  combined  expenditures  and  transfers

15

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

increased ($17.5 billion), resulting in only a $7 million fund balance increase from the prior year. The increase
in Federal Fund revenues, expenditures, and transfers was primarily the result of economic stimulus funding
from  ARRA  that  was  mainly  used  for  health  and  human  services  and  education  expenditures.  The  ARRA
unemployment  subsidy  of  $13.3 billion  was  transferred  to  the  Unemployment  Programs  Fund,  a  major
enterprise fund.

Transportation Fund: This fund accounts for fuel taxes, bond proceeds, and other revenues used primarily for
highway  and  passenger  rail  construction.  The  Transportation  Fund’s  revenues  decreased  by  5.9%  and
expenditures  decreased  by  2.6%.  Fund  expenditures  of  $11.4 billion  exceeded  revenues  by  $3.6 billion;
however, there were net receipts of $3.9 billion from other financing sources, such as general obligation bonds
issued during the year and transfers from the General Fund. The Transportation Fund ended the fiscal year
with a $7.0 billion fund balance, an increase of $321 million over the prior year.

Proprietary Funds

Enterprise  Funds:  Most  of  the  State’s  enterprise  funds  experienced  decreases  in  their  net  assets  during  the
2009-10  fiscal  year.  The  most  significant  decrease  was  in  the  Unemployment  Programs  Fund,  whose  net
assets  decreased  during  the  year  by  $5.1  billion  to  a  negative  $6.6  billion,  because  California  continues  to
struggle with high unemployment.

As shown on the Statement of Net Assets of the proprietary funds, total assets of the enterprise funds were
$37.5  billion  as  of  June  30,  2010.  Of  this  amount,  current  assets  totaled  $8.3  billion  and  noncurrent  assets
totaled $29.2 billion. The largest changes in asset account balances were a $1.4 billion increase in cash and
pooled investments in the Public Building Construction Fund and a $939 million decrease in recoverable power
costs  in  the  Electric  Power  Fund.  The  total  liabilities  of  the  enterprise  funds  were  $38.2  billion.  The  largest
liability of the enterprise funds is for bonds payable—$23.4 billion of revenue bonds payable and $1.4 billion of
general  obligation  bonds  payable.  The  increase  in  revenue  bonds  payable  was  primarily  the  result  of
$2.3 billion  in  new  lease-purchase  revenue  bonds  issued  for  the  Public  Building  Construction  Fund.  The
issuance of these bonds also explains the increase in the cash and pooled investment account balance in this
fund  since  the  bond  proceeds  received  during  the  year  were  not  fully  expended  by  year-end.  During  the
2009-10 fiscal year, the State continued to obtain loans from the U.S Department of Labor to cover deficits in
the Unemployment Programs Fund. The balance due on these loans as of June 30, 2010 was $7.2 billion, an
increase of $5.3 billion over the prior year.

Total  net  assets  of  the  enterprise  funds  were  a  negative  $757 million  as  of  June  30,  2010.  Total  net  assets
consisted of three segments: expendable restricted net assets of $3.4 billion, investment in capital assets (net
of  related  debt)  of  $89 million,  and  unrestricted  net  assets  of  negative  $4.3 billion.  The  Unemployment
Programs Fund had a deficit of $6.6 billion, a $5.1 billion (337.3%) decrease in net assets from the prior year.
The net assets of all other enterprise funds experienced small changes during the year.

The large decrease in net assets of the Unemployment Programs Fund is the result of the State’s continued
high  demand  for  unemployment  benefits.  The  Unemployment  Programs  Fund  became  insolvent  in
January 2009 and has continued to deteriorate as California’s unemployment rate rose to a high of 12.6% in
March 2010.  In  addition  to  the  federal  loans  outstanding  at  June  30,  2010,  the  State  anticipates  requesting
additional  loans  to  cover  projected  deficits  throughout  2011.  In  its  October  2010  forecast,  the  Employment
Development  Department  projected  that  the  fund  will  end  2011  with  a  deficit  of  $13.4 billion.  To  restore
solvency,  the  State  must  increase  employer  taxes,  reduce  benefits,  or  do  some  combination  of  the  two.
Without corrective action, the Unemployment Programs Fund will remain insolvent for the foreseeable future
and the interest payments on the federal loans, which are waived until after December 2010 under ARRA, will

in

As  shown  on  the  Statement  of  Revenues,  Expenses,  and  Changes  in  Fund  Net  Assets  of  the  proprietary
funds,  the  enterprise  funds  ended  the  year  with  operating  revenues  of  $19.6  billion,  operating  expenses  of
$37.2 billion, and net disbursements from other transactions of $1.2 billion. The largest sources of operating
revenue were unemployment and disability insurance receipts of $11.2 billion in the Unemployment Programs
Fund  and  power  sales  of  $3.0  billion  collected  by  the  Electric  Power  Fund.  The  largest  operating  expenses
were distributions to beneficiaries of $29.4 billion by the Unemployment Programs Fund and power purchases
(net  of  recoverable  costs)  of  $3.0  billion  by  the  Electric  Power  Fund.  The  Unemployment  Programs  Fund
expenses were partially subsidized by $13.3 billion of ARRA economic stimulus funding transferred from the
Federal  Fund.  The  ending  net  assets  of  the  enterprise  funds  at  June  30,  2010,  were  a  negative
$757 million—$5.2 billion less than the prior year’s ending net assets of $4.4 billion.

Internal Service Funds: Total net assets of the internal service funds were $529 million as of June 30, 2010.
These net assets consist of two segments: investment in capital assets (net of related debt) of $163 million and
unrestricted net assets of $366 million.

Fiduciary Funds

The  State  of  California  has  four  types  of  fiduciary  funds:  private  purpose  trust  funds,  pension  and  other
employee benefit trust funds, investment trust funds, and agency funds. The private purpose trust funds ended
the fiscal year with net assets of $3.6 billion. The pension and other employee benefit trust funds ended the
fiscal  year  with  net  assets  of  $341.6  billion.  The  State’s  only  investment  trust  fund,  the  Local  Agency
Investment Fund, ended the fiscal year with net assets of $23.3 billion. Agency funds act as clearing accounts
and thus do not have net assets.

For the year ended June 30, 2010, the fiduciary funds’ combined net assets were $368.5 billion, a $34.0 billion
increase from prior year net assets. The increase in net assets for these funds was mainly attributable to an
increase  in  investment  income  and  an  increase  in  the  fair  value  of  the  funds’  investments  of  $30.0 billion
(8.3%).

The Economy for the Year Ending June 30, 2010

In  September  2010,  the  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research  (NBER)  declared  that  the  recession  had
officially  ended  in  June  2009.  In  fact,  the  first  three  months  of  the  2009-10  fiscal  year  saw  the  first  growth
(1.6%) in the nation’s real gross domestic product (GDP) after nearly six consecutive quarters of decline. Each
of the remaining quarters of the 2009-10 fiscal year also showed growth in the U.S. economic output. Most of
the growth during the first half of the 2009-10 fiscal year was in business inventories, which firms replenished
after drawing them down significantly during the recession. However, both business investment and consumer
spending began to contribute to GDP growth during the second half of the fiscal year.

Though  the  national  economy  had  halted  its  decline  in  the  first  part  of  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,  California’s
labor market  did  not  show  a  corresponding  recovery.  Through  the  first  half  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  State
sustained continued job losses—total nonfarm employment hit a low in December 2009 that was down more
than  9%  from  its  July  2007  peak.  The  unemployment  rate  continued  to  increase  in  the  first  three  months  of
2010, reaching the highest level in decades, 12.6%, in March 2010.

California, in addition to experiencing continued trouble in its labor markets, did not see much recovery in the
housing market during the 2009-10 fiscal year. Median home prices showed that California’s housing market

17

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

stabilized somewhat by the time the 2009-10 fiscal year started. During the first six months of the fiscal year,
California  experienced  consecutive  months  of  home  price  increases,  and  home  sales  averaged  nearly
39,000 units per month—an increase of more than 1,500 per month over the previous fiscal year. This small
growth  can  be  attributed  to  the  federal  government’s  intervention  in  the  housing  market  with  first-time
homebuyer tax credits and low interest rates, and the Federal Housing Administration’s continued willingness
to make loans available to the lower end of the market. With the tax credit in effect for only some of the second
half of the fiscal year, both home prices and sales stabilized somewhat during that period. 

California’s housing market recovery was also hindered by continued problems in the mortgage market. More
than 346,000 notices of default and 192,000 foreclosures were recorded during the 2009-10 fiscal year. As a
result, California’s residential construction and construction employment did not improve much during the fiscal
year—just  40,000  residential  building  permits  were  issued  (a  14.9%  reduction  from  the  2008-09  fiscal  year)
and the construction industry lost another 73,600 jobs. However, the number of construction jobs lost in the
2009-10 fiscal year was almost 60% lower than the number of construction jobs lost in the previous fiscal year.

Despite  these  challenges,  the  economic  news  in  California  was  not  all  bad  during  the  2009-10  fiscal  year.
California saw some modest job growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The State’s total nonfarm payrolls
expanded  by  almost  75,000  jobs  during  this  time.  Many  of  these  were  temporary  jobs  associated  with  the
2010 Census; however, the private sector also saw more than 55,000 jobs created in the second half of the
2009-10 fiscal year. While the job gains were certainly insufficient to make up for the 1.4 million jobs lost since
the  beginning  of  the  recession,  they  were  an  indication  that  California  was  able  to  stop  the  losses  in  its
employment market by the end of the fiscal year. Several other indicators signaled a recovery on California’s
horizon. Personal income in California was on the rise during the last three quarters of the 2009-10 fiscal year.
After remaining relatively flat in the first quarter, California’s personal income ended the year up 2.8% from the
July-September low. California’s consumer spending also grew in the 2009-10 fiscal year. Although the fiscal
year  ended  with  taxable  sales  down  3.4%  from  the  2008-09  fiscal  year,  all  but  the  third  quarter  showed
increases in taxable sales.

Personal  income  and  taxable  sales,  which  play  a  massive  role  in  both  California’s  economy  and  the  State’s
revenue, ended the 2009-10 fiscal year moving in the right direction. The labor and housing markets continued
to face challenges during the 2009-10 fiscal year, but both found some stability as the year ended. There is no
doubt that the 2009-10 fiscal year was another tough year for California’s economy, but the year ended with
indications that California’s economy in the 2010-11 fiscal year will continue to improve.

General Fund Budget Highlights

The  original  General  Fund  budget  of  $98.6  billion  was  decreased  by  $5.8  billion.  This  decrease  is  mainly
comprised  of  reductions  to  various  health  and  human  service  programs  that  are  not  mandated  or  have
alternative  funding,  such  as  increased  federal  stimulus  funds,  available.  During  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,
General Fund actual budgetary basis expenditures were $87.5 billion, $5.3 billion less than the final budgeted
amounts.

Capital Assets and Debt Administration

Capital Assets

The State’s investment in capital assets for its governmental and business-type activities as of June 30, 2010,
amounted to $105.6 billion (net of accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes land,
state  highway  infrastructure,  collections,  buildings  and  other  depreciable  property,  and  construction  in
progress.  Depreciable  property  includes  buildings,  improvements  other  than  buildings,  equipment,  personal
property, intangible assets, certain infrastructure assets, certain books, and other capitalized and depreciable
property. Infrastructure assets, such as roads and bridges, are items that are normally immovable and can be
preserved for a greater number of years than can most capital assets.

The budget authorized $8.5 billion for the State’s capital outlay program in the 2009-10 fiscal year, not including
funding for state highway infrastructure and K-12 schools. State highway infrastructure assets are discussed in
more detail in the Required Supplementary Information that follows the notes to the financial statements. Of the
$8.5 billion authorized, $255 million was from the General Fund; $5.6 billion was from lease-revenue bonds;
$1.9 billion was from proceeds of various general obligation bonds; and $769 million was from reimbursements,
federal  funds,  and  special  funds. These  amounts  include  reappropriations  and  other  funds  carried  over  from
previous budgets for continuing projects. 

The major new capital projects authorized include:

$290  million  in  lease-revenue  bonds  for  the  Department  of  Forestry  and  Fire  Protection,  for  projects
including the replacement of three unit headquarters, three conservation camps, and five fire stations; 

$256  million  for  numerous  construction  projects  within  the  University  of  California,  the  California  State
University, and the California Community Colleges;

$177 million for projects to replace structurally deficient court facilities; and

$48  million  in  lease-revenue  bonds  for  the  Department  of  Food  and  Agriculture  to  replace  an  outdated
border protection station.

Note 7, Capital Assets, includes additional information on the State’s capital assets.

Modified Approach for Infrastructure Assets

The  State  uses  the  modified  approach  to  report  the  cost  of  its  infrastructure  assets  (state  roadways  and
bridges). Under the modified approach, the State does not report depreciation expense for roads and bridges

20

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

but  capitalizes  all  costs  that  add  to  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  State-owned  roads  and  bridges.  All
maintenance and preservation costs are expensed and not capitalized. Under the modified approach, the State
maintains  an  asset  management  system  to  demonstrate  that  it  is  preserving  the  infrastructure  at  or  above
established condition levels. The State is responsible for maintaining 49,477 lane miles and 12,322 bridges.

During the 2009-10 fiscal year, the actual amount spent on preservation was 15.5% of the estimated budgeted
amount needed to maintain the infrastructure assets at the established-condition levels. Although the amount
spent  fell  short  of  the  budgeted  amount,  the  assessed  conditions  of  the  State’s  bridges  and  roadways  are
better than the established condition baselines.

The Required Supplementary Information includes additional information on how the State uses the modified
approach for infrastructure assets; it also presents the established condition standards, condition assessments,
and preservation costs.

Debt Administration

At June 30, 2010, the primary government had total bonded debt outstanding of $111.4 billion. Of this amount,
$79.2 billion (71.1%) represents general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
State. Included in the $79.2 billion of general obligation bonds is $7.9 billion of Economic Recovery bonds that
are  secured  by  a  pledge  of  revenues  derived  from  dedicated  sales  and  use  taxes.  The  current  portion  of
general  obligation  bonds  outstanding  is  $2.6  billion  and  the  long-term  portion  is  $76.6 billion.  The  remaining
$32.2 billion  (28.9%)  of  bonded  debt  outstanding  represents  revenue  bonds,  which  are  secured  solely  by
specified revenue sources. The current portion of revenue bonds outstanding is $1.3 billion and the long-term
portion is $30.9 billion.

Table  5  presents  a  summary  of  the  primary  government’s  long-term  obligations  for  governmental  and
business-type activities.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The  primary  government’s  total  long-term  obligations  increased  during  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010.
Governmental  activities  general  obligation  bonds  payable  had  the  largest  increase  ($9.1 billion),  but  other
notable  increases  occurred  in  net  other  postemployment  benefits  obligation,  mandated  costs,  and  loans
payable.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  State  issued  $11.8  billion  in  new  general  obligation  bonds  for  public
education  facilities,  transportation  projects,  housing  and  emergency  shelters,  and  various  water  and  flood
control projects. The net other postemployment benefits obligation increased because the State does not fully
fund the annual cost of these benefits.

Note  10,  Long-term  Obligations,  and  Notes  11  through  17  include  additional  information  on  the  State’s
long-term obligations.

In  July  2009,  Fitch  and  Moody’s  Investors  Service  reduced  the  State’s  general  obligation  bond  credit  rating
from “A-” to “BBB” and from “A2” to “Baa1,” respectively. They cited the State’s continued inability to achieve
timely agreement on budgetary and cash flow solutions to its severe fiscal crisis and its use of IOUs for non-
priority payments. In January 2010, Standard and Poor’s lowered its rating on the State’s general obligation
bonds  from  “A”  to  “A-”  citing  the  State’s  severe  fiscal  imbalance  and  the  impending  recurrence  of  a  cash
deficiency. However, in April 2010, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch raised the State’s general obligation
bond  credit  rating  to  “A1”  from  “Baa1”  and  to  “A-”  from  “BBB”,  respectively.  The  rating  change  reflects  a
recalibration or change in scale of certain public finance ratings and does not reflect a change in credit quality.

Recent Economic Condition and Future Budgets

Recent Economic Condition

The  economic  outlook  for  the  nation  and  California  continued  to  improve  during  the  first  six  months  of  the
2010-11 fiscal year. The decline in employment that accompanied the recession leveled out, but the recovery
has  yet  to  produce  any  significant  job  growth  in  California  and  has  not  come  close  to  replacing  the  nearly
1.4 million jobs lost between July 2007 and December 2009. After reaching a high in March 2010, California’s
unemployment  rate  edged  down  and  held  at  12.4%  for  several  months  before  moving  back  up  to  12.5%  in
December 2010. Even though California regained only 12,800 jobs during the first half of the 2010-11 fiscal
year, the job market is moving in the right direction. The sectors with the largest increases were Professional
and Business Services, Education and Health Services, and Leisure and Hospitality.

The housing market remains depressed as the mortgage industry struggles following the housing collapse in
Spring 2009. The Mortgage Bankers’ Association estimates that almost 12% of all mortgages in the state are
seriously delinquent (payment 60+ days past due or in the foreclosure process). Many homeowners owe more
to  the  bank  than  their  homes  are  worth.  Home  prices  were  relatively  weak  during  the  first  half  of  the
2010-11 fiscal  year,  but  this  was  largely  the  result  of  expiring  federal  tax  credits  for  new  home  purchases.
Home sales dropped off dramatically in the first quarter of the 2010-11 fiscal year, which also brought home
prices  down  slightly.  The  decline  in  home  prices  increased  the  affordability  of  housing  in  California,  and  in
December  2010,  California  saw  an  increase  in  home  sales  by  more  than  15%  over  November.  The  State’s
housing permits averaged 3,512 residential units per month during the first five months of the 2010-11 fiscal
year—well below the 2005 peak—but the number for December 2010 rose to 5,699. However, this increase
may have occurred in response to changes in the building code that went into effect on January 1, 2011.

The State’s General Fund revenues continued to improve in the first half of the 2010-11 fiscal year. Sales tax
receipts were 2.7% higher than at the same point in the 2009-10 fiscal year, driven by increases in consumer
spending. Personal income tax receipts are up even more significantly, at 17.9% above receipts for the first
half  of  the  2009-10  fiscal  year.  Some  part  of  this  increase  is  due  to  a  change  in  estimated  tax  payment

22

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

percentages, but the increase is also partly the result of a genuine increase in income and payroll. Personal
income in California increased again during the first quarter of the 2010-11 fiscal year, rising 3.4% from its low
point at the same time last year. Additionally, despite only modest gains in the number of jobs, average weekly
hours  worked  are  rising  in  California;  specifically,  through  November  2010,  the  average  weekly  hours  in
manufacturing rose to 40.3 from the fiscal 2009-10 average of 39.8.

While  recent  economic  conditions  both  nationwide  and  in  California  show  that  a  recovery  is  underway,
conditions remain difficult for businesses and residents across the state. The labor markets have grown more
slowly  than  most  Californians  had  hoped.  Housing,  while  stabilizing,  still  has  issues  to  work  through  in  the
mortgage markets. The economy may have turned the corner, but it will take several years of sustained growth
before California returns to its pre-recession peak of activity.

California’s 2010-11 Budget

California’s 2010-11 Budget Act was enacted on October 8, 2010, 100 days after the fiscal year began. The
Budget Act appropriated $125.3 billion—$86.6 billion from the General Fund, $30.9 billion from special funds,
and $7.8 billion from bond funds. The 2010 Budget Act holds General Fund spending essentially flat compared
to the prior year—$86.6 billion in 2010-11 compared to $86.3 billion in 2009-10. The General Fund’s available
resources were projected to be $94.2 billion, with a reserve for economic uncertainties of $1.3 billion. General
Fund revenues come predominantly from taxes, with personal income taxes expected to provide 50% of total
revenue. California’s major taxes (personal income, sales and use, and corporation taxes) were projected to
supply approximately 90% of the General Fund’s resources in the 2010-11 fiscal year.

The spending plan enacted $19.3 billion in budget actions to solve a General Fund gap between resources and
expenditures, which was estimated in May 2010 to be near $17.9 billion. These budget package solutions can
be categorized into four major areas: expenditure-related solutions; new federal funding; revenue actions; and
one-time loans, transfers, and funding shifts. The $7.8 billion in expenditure-related solutions include ongoing
and  temporary  cost  or  service  reductions  in  virtually  every  state  program,  but  primarily  in  K-12  and  higher
education, employee compensation, and health and social services. Proposed new revenues from the federal
government  were  budgeted  at  $5.4  billion,  even  though  most  of  the  funding  has  not  yet  been  approved  by
Congress. Revenue actions included a $1.4 billion increase in the baseline forecast of personal income and
corporation tax revenues, and the sale and leaseback of state office buildings. In addition, businesses are not
able to use net operating losses to reduce their tax liability for two more years. These revenue actions would
result  in  a  total  increase  in  revenue  of  $3.3  billion.  The  budget  also  included  $2.7 billion  in  one-time  loans,
transfers,  and  funding  shifts,  of  which  a  significant  portion  relates  to  the  State’s  transportation  accounts.
However,  in  November  2010,  the  voters  approved  Proposition  22,  which  protects  existing  funds  allocated  to
local governments, public safety, and transportation. The initiative prohibits the State from using these funds
and could have an impact on the 2010-11 budget. 

The  proposed  2011-12  Governor’s  Budget  provides  revised  revenue  and  expenditure  estimates  for  the
2010-11  fiscal  year.  If  no  corrective  action  is  taken  by  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature,  the  revised  gap
between  General  Fund  revenues  and  expenditures  is  expected  to  be  $8.2  billion  by  the  end  of  the
2010-11 fiscal year. The October 2010 estimate of a $1.3 billion reserve balance decreased to an estimated
$8.2  billion  shortfall  by  January  2011  because  the  revised  revenue  and  expenditures  estimates  show  that
significantly less revenue is expected from the federal government and other sources, and because some of
the planned budget solutions are not expected to be achieved during the 2010-11 fiscal year. The Governor’s
2011-12  plan  includes  $4.1  billion  in  revenue  and  other  solutions  for  the  2010-11  fiscal  year  that  could
significantly reduce the projected gap. However, these solutions require timely legislative and voter action. The
Governor’s proposed solutions are discussed further in the next section.

23

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

California’s 2011-12 Budget

The Governor released his proposed 2011-12 budget on January 10, 2011. This proposed budget projects a
$25.4  billion  gap  between  estimated  revenues  and  state  expenditures  over  the  next  18  months.  The
$25.4 billion  figure  is  comprised  of  an  $8.2  billion  deficit  carried  over  from  the  2010-11  fiscal  year,  and  a
$17.2 billion shortfall in the 2011-12 fiscal year. The Governor’s Budget proposes $12.5 billion in expenditure-
related  solutions,  $12.0  billion  in  net  new  revenues,  and  $1.9  billion  borrowed  from  special  funds  and  other
sources. If enacted, the Governor’s proposed budget package would cut the 2010-11 fiscal year deficit in half
and leave the state with a surplus of $1.0 billion by the end of the 2011-12 fiscal year. A vast majority of the
budget actions are not one-time solutions, but are intended to last beyond the 2011-12 fiscal year. However, to
achieve these results, the Governor’s plan relies on legislative approval of statutory changes by March 2011
and voter approval of almost all of the $12.0 billion revenue solutions in a June 2011 special election.

The 2011-12 Governor’s Budget projects (with all budget solutions enacted) that 2011-12 fiscal year General
Fund revenues and transfers will be $89.7 billion and expenditures will be about $84.6 billion, with a $1 billion
reserve.  Proposed  2011-12  General  Fund  revenues  and  transfers  are  4.8%  less  than  the  revised  2010-11
estimate  of  $94.2  billion,  while  2011-12  General  Fund  expenditures  are  8.2%  less  than  the  revised  2010-11
estimate of $92.2 billion. Almost all of the Governor’s proposed new revenue is derived from the extension of
the four temporary tax increases adopted in February 2009 that the Governor plans to submit to voters in a
June 2011 special election. A portion of this new revenue would be dedicated to local governments as part of a
proposed restructuring of the State-local relationship in the delivery of certain services. The Governor’s plan
shifts responsibility for these services to local governments, resulting in a shift of approximately $5.9 billion in
state  program  costs  to  local  governments  with  a  comparable  amount  of  the  new  dedicated  revenue.  The
Governor  also  proposes  a  significant  change  to  the  way  local  redevelopment  activities  are  funded  and
proposes  the  elimination  of  redevelopment  agencies,  which  would  provide  a  shift  of  redevelopment  funds  to
cover Medi-Cal and trial court spending. Other expenditure-related solutions include reductions in services and
benefits  in  nearly  every  area  of  state  spending,  including  a  $1.7  billion  reduction  in  Medi-Cal  benefits  and
provider  payments  and  a  $1.0  billion  reduction  in  higher  education  spending,  and  the  use  of  other  funding
sources, such as tobacco excise taxes and vehicle weight fees, to reduce General Fund expenditures.

According  to  the  Legislative  Analyst’s  Office  (LAO),  California’s  nonpartisan  fiscal  and  policy  advisor,  the
administration’s  estimate  of  the  budget  shortfall  is  reasonable.  The  LAO  credits  the  Governor’s  efforts  to
develop a budget plan that is focused on multiyear and ongoing solutions and sees merit in his proposals to
realign  state  and  local  program  responsibilities,  eliminate  redevelopment  agencies,  and  enact  key  budget
legislation by March 2011. However, the LAO suggests that there are significant risks to the Governor’s plan
and significant work ahead to fill in the details of the realignment and redevelopment proposals, which involve
many legal, financial, and policy issues.

Fund Financial Statements

Total fund balances – governmental funds

$

13,762,988 

Amounts  reported  for  governmental  activities  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  are  different  from  those  in  the
Governmental Funds Balance Sheet because:

(cid:129) Capital  assets  used  in  governmental  activities  are  not  financial  resources  and,  therefore,  are  not  reported  in

98,594,437

Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of
Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities

(amounts in thousands)

Fund Financial Statements

Net change in fund balances – total governmental funds 

$

3,778,599 

Amounts  reported  for  governmental  activities  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  are  different  from  those  in  the
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of Governmental Funds because:

(cid:129) Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the Statement of Activities, the cost of
those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense. This is the amount by which
capital outlays exceed depreciation in the current period.

2,124,343 

(cid:129) Revenues  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  that  do  not  provide  current  financial  resources  are  deferred  and  not

43,035 

reported as revenues in the funds.

(cid:129) Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain activities, such as architectural,
procurement, and technology services, to individual funds. The net revenue (expense) of the internal service
funds is reported with governmental activities. 

156,210 

(cid:129) Bonds and other noncurrent financing instruments provide current financial resources to governmental funds in
the  form  of  debt,  which  increases  long-term  liabilities  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets.  Repayment  of  bond
principal  is  an  expenditure  in  the  governmental  funds,  but  the  repayment  reduces  long-term  liabilities  in  the
Statement of Net Assets. The following amounts represent the difference between proceeds and repayments:

General obligation bond

Revenue bond

Certificates of participation and commercial paper

(9,461,721)

175,916 

65,789 

(9,220,016)

(cid:129) Some  expenses  reported  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  do  not  require  the  use  of  current  financial  resources

and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures in governmental funds.

Compensated absences

Capital leases

Net other postemployment benefits obligation

Mandated costs

Workers’ compensation

Pollution remediation obligations

Other noncurrent liabilities

Notes to the Financial Statements

NOTE 1:  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying financial statements present information on the financial activities of the State of California
over which the Governor, the Legislature, and other elected officials have direct or indirect governing and fiscal
control.  These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The provisions of the following Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statements have been implemented for the year ended June 30, 2010:

GASB Statement No. 51, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets; and

GASB Statement No. 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments.

A. Reporting Entity

These financial statements present the primary government of the State and its component units. The primary
government consists of all funds, organizations, institutions, agencies, departments, and offices that are not
legally separate from the State. Component units are organizations that are legally separate from the State
but for which the State is financially accountable or organizations whose relationship with the State is such that
exclusion would cause the State’s financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The decision to include
a  component  unit  in  the  State’s  reporting  entity  is  based  on  several  criteria,  including  legal  standing,  fiscal
dependency,  and  financial  accountability.  Following  is  information  on  the  blended,  fiduciary,  and  discretely
presented component units of the State.

1. Blended Component Units 

Blended  component  units,  although  legally  separate  entities,  are  in  substance  part  of  the  primary
government’s  operations.  Therefore,  data  from  these  blended  component  units  are  integrated  into  the
appropriate funds for reporting purposes.

Building  authorities  are  blended  component  units  because  they  have  been  created  through  the  use  of  joint
exercise-of-powers agreements with various cities to finance the construction of state buildings. The building
authorities are reported as capital projects funds. As a result, capital lease arrangements between the building
authorities  and  the  State  in  the  amount  of  $427  million  have  been  eliminated  from  the  financial  statements.
Instead,  only  the  underlying  capital  assets  and  the  debt  used  to  acquire  them  are  reported  in  the
government-wide financial statements. For information on how to obtain copies of the financial statements of
the  building  authorities,  contact  the  State  Controller’s  Office,  Division  of  Accounting  and  Reporting,
P.O. Box 942850, Sacramento, California 94250-5872. 

The  Golden  State  Tobacco  Securitization  Corporation  (GSTSC)  is  a  not-for-profit  corporation  established
through  legislation  in  September  2002  solely  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  Tobacco  Settlement  Revenues
from the State. The five voting members of the State Public Works Board serve ex officio as the directors of
the corporation. GSTSC is authorized to issue bonds necessary to provide sufficient funds for carrying out its
purpose. GSTSC is reported in the combining statements in the Nonmajor Governmental Funds section as a
special revenue fund. For information on how to obtain copies of the financial statements of GSTSC, contact

the  Department  of  Finance,  Natural  Resources,  Energy,  Environmental,  and  Capital  Outlay  Section,
915 L Street, 9th Floor, Sacramento, California 94814.

2. Fiduciary Component Units

The State has two fiduciary component units that administer pension and other employee benefit trust funds.
These entities are legally separate from the State and meet the definition of a component unit because they
are fiscally dependent on the State; however, due to their fiduciary nature, they are presented in the Fiduciary
Fund  Statements  as  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds,  along  with  other  primary  government
fiduciary funds.

The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) administers pension and health benefit plans
for state employees, non-teaching school employees, and employees of California public agencies. Its Board
of  Administration  has  plenary  authority  and  fiduciary  responsibility  for  the  investment  of  monies  and  the
administration  of  the  plans.  CalPERS  administers  the  following  seven  pension  and  other  employee  benefit
trust  funds:    the  Public  Employees’  Retirement  Fund,  the  Judges’  Retirement  Fund,  the  Judges’  Retirement
Fund II, the Legislators’ Retirement Fund, the State Peace Officers’ and Firefighters’ Defined Contribution Plan
Fund,  the  public  agency  Deferred  Compensation  Program,  and  the  public  employee  Supplemental
Contributions Program Fund. Copies of CalPERS’ separately issued financial statements may be obtained in
writing from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, Fiscal Services Division, P.O. Box 942703,
Sacramento, California 94229-2703.

The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers pension benefit plans for California
public school teachers and certain other employees of the public school system. CalSTRS administers three
pension and other employee benefit trust funds: the State Teachers’ Retirement Fund; the Teachers’ Health
Benefits Fund; and the Pension2 Program. Copies of CalSTRS’ separately issued financial statements may be
obtained  from  the  California  State  Teachers’  Retirement  System,  P.O.  Box  15275,  Sacramento,  California
95851-0275.

3. Discretely Presented Component Units

Enterprise  activity  of  discretely  presented  component  units  is  reported  in  a  separate  column  in  the
government-wide  financial  statements.  Discretely  presented  component  units  are  legally  separate  from  the
primary government and mostly provide services to entities and individuals outside the primary government.
Discretely  presented  component  units  that  report  enterprise  activity  include  the  University  of  California,  the
State Compensation Insurance Fund, the California Housing Finance Agency, the Public Employees’ Benefits
Fund, and nonmajor component units. 

The  University  of  California  was  founded  in  1868  as  a  public,  state-supported,  land  grant  institution.  It  was
written  into  the  State  Constitution  of  1879  as  a  public  trust  to  be  administered  by  a  governing  board,  the
Regents of the University of California (the Regents). The University of California is a component unit of the
State because the State appoints a voting majority of the regents and because expenditures for the support of
various university programs and capital outlay are appropriated by the annual Budget Act. The University of
California offers defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans to its employees through
the University of California Retirement System (UCRS), a fiduciary responsibility of the Regents. The financial
information of the UCRS is not included in the financial statements of this report due to its fiduciary nature.
Copies of the University of California’s financial statements may be obtained from the University of California,
Financial Accounting, 1111 Franklin Street, 10th Floor, Oakland, California 94607-5200.

60

Notes to the Financial Statements

The  State  Compensation  Insurance  Fund  (SCIF)  is  a  self-supporting  enterprise  created  to  offer  insurance
protection to employers at the lowest possible cost. It operates in competition with other insurance carriers to
provide services to the State, counties, cities, school districts, and corporations. It is a component unit of the
State because the State appoints all 11 voting members of SCIF’s governing board and has the authority to
approve  or  modify  SCIF’s  budget.  Copies  of  SCIF’s 
the  year  ended
December 31, 2009,  may  be  obtained  from  the  State  Compensation  Insurance  Fund,  P.O.  Box  420807,
San Francisco, California 94142-0807.

financial  statements 

for 

The  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  (CalHFA)  was  created  by  the  Zenovich-Moscone-Chacon  Housing
and  Home  Finance  Act,  as  amended.  CalHFA’s  purpose  is  financing  the  housing  needs  of  persons  and
families of low and moderate income. It is a component unit of the State because the State appoints a voting
majority  of  CalHFA’s  governing  board  and  has  the  authority  to  approve  or  modify  its  budget.  Copies  of
CalHFA’s financial statements may be obtained from the California Housing Finance Agency, P.O. Box 4034,
Sacramento, California 95812.

The Public Employees’ Benefits Fund, which is administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement
System,  accounts  for  contributions  and  premiums  for  public  employee  long-term  care  plans  and  for
administration  of  a  deferred  compensation  program.  Copies  of  CalPERS’  separately  issued  financial
statements  may  be  obtained  in  writing  from  the  California  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System,  Fiscal
Services Division, P.O. Box 942703, Sacramento, California 94229-2703.

State  legislation  created  various  nonmajor  component  units  to  provide  certain  services  outside  the  primary
government and to provide certain private and public entities with a low-cost source of financing for programs
deemed to be in the public interest. The California Pollution Control Financing Authority, the San Joaquin River
Conservancy, and the district agricultural associations are considered component units because they have a
fiscal dependency on the primary government. The California Educational Facilities Authority is considered a
component  unit  because  its  exclusion  from  the  financial  statements  would  be  misleading  because  of  its
relationship  to  the  primary  government.  California  State  University  auxiliary  organizations  are  considered
component  units  because  they  exist  entirely  or  almost  entirely  for  the  direct  benefit  of  the  universities.  The
remaining  nonmajor  component  units  are  considered  component  units  because  the  majority  of  members  of
their  governing  boards  are  appointed  by  or  are  members  of  the  primary  government,  because  the  primary
government can impose its will on the entity, or because the entity provides a specific financial benefit to the
primary government. For information on how to obtain copies of the financial statements of these component
units,  contact  the  State  Controller’s  Office,  Division  of  Accounting  and  Reporting,  P.O. Box 942850,
Sacramento, California 94250-5872. 

The nonmajor component units are:

The  California  Alternative  Energy  and  Advanced  Transportation  Financing  Authority,  which  provides
financing for alternative energy and advanced transportation technologies;

The  California  Infrastructure  and  Economic  Development  Bank,  which  provides  financing  for  business
development and public improvements;

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority, which provides financing for pollution control facilities;

The California Health Facilities Financing Authority, which provides financing for the construction, equipping,
and acquisition of health facilities;

61

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The  California  Educational  Facilities  Authority,  which  issues  revenue  bonds  to  finance  loans  for  students
attending public and private nonprofit colleges and universities and to assist private educational institutions
of higher learning in financing the expansion and construction of educational facilities (the EdFund financial
report included in this entity is as of and for the year ended September 30, 2009);

The California School Finance Authority, which provides loans to school and community college districts to
assist them in obtaining equipment and facilities;

California  State  University  auxiliary  organizations,  which  provide  services  primarily  to  university  students
through  foundations,  associated  student  organizations,  student  unions,  food  service  entities,  book  stores,
and similar organizations;

District  agricultural  associations,  which  exhibit  all  of  the  industries,  industrial  enterprises,  resources,  and
products of the state (the district agricultural association’s financial report is as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2009);

The University of California Hastings College of the Law, which was established as the law department of
the University of California to provide legal education programs and operates independently under its own
board  of  directors.  The  college  has  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  the  Foundation,  that  provides
private sources of funds for academic programs, scholarships, and faculty research;

The San Joaquin River Conservancy, which was created to acquire and manage public lands within the San
Joaquin River Parkway; and

The California Urban Waterfront Area Restoration Financing Authority, which provides financing for coastal
and inland urban waterfront restoration projects.

4. Joint Venture

A joint venture is an entity resulting from a contractual arrangement; it is owned, operated, or governed by two
or more participants as a separate and specific activity subject to joint control. In such an arrangement, the
participants  retain  an  ongoing  financial  interest  or  an  ongoing  financial  responsibility  in  the  entity.  These
entities are not part of the primary government or a component unit.

The  State  participates  in  a  joint  venture  called  the  Capitol  Area  Development  Authority  (CADA).  CADA  was
created in 1978 by the joint exercise of powers agreement between the primary government and the City of
Sacramento for the location of state buildings and other improvements. CADA is a public entity, separate from
the primary government and the city, and is administered by a board of five members: two appointed by the
primary government, two appointed by the city, and one appointed by the affirmative vote of at least three of
the  other  four  members  of  the  board.  The  primary  government  designates  the  chairperson  of  the  board.
Although the primary government does not have an equity interest in CADA, it does have an ongoing financial
interest. Based upon the appointment authority, the primary government has the ability to indirectly influence
CADA to undertake special projects for the citizenry of the participants. The primary government subsidizes
CADA’s operations by leasing land to CADA without consideration; however, the primary government is not
obligated to do so. At June 30, 2010, CADA had total assets of $34.8 million, total liabilities of $20.1 million,
and total net assets of $14.7 million. Total revenues for the fiscal year were $10.4 million and expenses were
$9.4 million,  resulting  in  a  change  in  net  assets  of  $1.0  million.  Because  the  primary  government  does  not
have an equity interest in CADA, CADA’s financial information is not included in the financial statements of this
report. Separately issued financial statements may be obtained from the Capitol Area Development Authority,
1522 14th Street, Sacramento, California 95814-5958.

Notes to the Financial Statements

5. Related Organizations

A  related  organization  is  an  organization  for  which  a  primary  government  is  accountable  because  that
government appoints a voting majority of the organization’s governing board, but for which it is not financially
accountable.

Chapter  854  of  the  Statutes  of  1996  created  an  Independent  System  Operator,  a  state-chartered,  nonprofit
market  institution.  The  Independent  System  Operator  provides  centralized  control  of  the  statewide  electrical
transmission  grid  to  ensure  the  efficient  use  and  reliable  operation  of  the  transmission  system.  The
Independent System Operator is governed by a five-member board, the members of which are appointed by
the  Governor  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate.  The  State’s  accountability  for  this  institution  does  not  extend
beyond  making  the  initial  oversight  board  appointments.  Because  the  primary  government  is  not  financially
accountable for the Independent System Operator, the financial information of this institution is not included in
the financial statements of this report. For information on how to obtain copies of the financial statements of
the Independent System Operator, contact the State Controller’s Office, Division of Accounting and Reporting,
P.O. Box 942850, Sacramento, California 94250-5872.

The  California  Earthquake  Authority  (CEA),  a  legally  separate  organization,  offers  earthquake  insurance  for
California  homeowners,  renters,  condominium  owners,  and  mobile  home  owners.  A  three-member  board  of
state-elected officials governs the CEA. The State’s accountability for this institution does not extend beyond
making  the  appointments.  Because  the  primary  government  is  not  financially  accountable  for  the  CEA,  the
financial information of this institution is not included in the financial statements of this report. For information
on how to obtain copies of the financial statements of the CEA, contact the California Earthquake Authority,
801 K Street, Suite 1000, Sacramento, California 95814.

The  Bay  Area  Toll  Authority  (BATA),  which  is  not  part  of  the  State’s  reporting  entity,  was  created  by  the
California Legislature in 1997 to administer a portion of the toll revenues collected from the San Francisco Bay
Area’s  seven  state-owned  toll  bridges  and  to  have  program  oversight  related  to  certain  bridge  construction
projects.  In  2005,  the  California  Legislature  transferred  toll-bridge  administration  responsibility  from  the
California  Department  of  Transportation  (Caltrans)  to  BATA.  This  responsibility  includes  consolidation  of  all
toll-bridge  revenue  under  BATA’s  administration.  BATA  is  a  blended  component  unit  of  the  Metropolitan
Transportation  Commission.  Additional  information  may  be  obtained  from  the  Metropolitan  Transportation
Commission, 101 Eighth Street, Oakland, California 94607.

63

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements

Government-wide  financial  statements  (the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  and  the  Statement  of  Activities)  give
information on all the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. The primary
government  is  reported  separately  from  legally  separate  component  units  for  which  the  State  is  financially
accountable. Within the primary government, the State’s governmental activities, which are normally supported
by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to
a significant extent on fees and charges for support. The effect of interfund activity has been removed from the
statements,  with  the  exception  of  amounts  between  governmental  and  business-type  activities,  which  are
presented  as  internal  balances  and  transfers.  Centralized  services  provided  by  the  General  Fund  for  other
funds are charged as direct costs to the funds that received those services. Also, the General Fund recovers
the cost of centralized services provided to federal programs from the federal government.

The Statement of Net Assets reports all of the financial and capital resources of the government as a whole in
a format where assets equal liabilities plus net assets. The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to
which the expenses of a given function are offset by program revenues. Program revenues include charges to
customers  who  purchase,  use,  or  directly  benefit  from  goods,  services,  or  privileges  provided  by  a  given
function. Program revenues also include grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational
or  capital  requirements  of  a  particular  function.  Taxes  and  other  items  that  are  not  program-related  are
reported as general revenues.

Fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar
component  units,  and  discretely  presented  component  units.  A  fund  is  a  fiscal  and  accounting  entity  with  a
self-balancing set of accounts. Fund accounting segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is
used  to  aid  management  in  demonstrating  compliance  with  finance-related  legal  and  contractual  provisions.
The  State  maintains  the  minimum  number  of  funds  consistent  with  legal  and  managerial  requirements.
Fiduciary  funds,  although  excluded  from  the  government-wide  statements,  are  included  in  the  fund  financial
statements. Major governmental and enterprise funds are reported in separate columns in the fund financial
statements.  Nonmajor  governmental  and  proprietary  funds  are  grouped  into  separate  columns.  Discretely
presented component unit statements, which follow the fiduciary fund statements, also separately report the
enterprise activity of the major discretely presented component units. In this report, the enterprise activity of
nonmajor discretely presented component units is grouped in a separate column.

Governmental fund types are used primarily to account for services provided to the general public without
direct charge.

The State reports the following major governmental funds.

The General Fund is the main operating fund of the State. It accounts for transactions related to resources
obtained and used for those services that do not need to be accounted for in another fund.

The Federal Fund accounts for the receipt and use of grants, entitlements, and shared revenues received
from the federal government.

The  Transportation  Fund  accounts  for  fuel  taxes,  including  the  State’s  diesel,  motor  vehicle,  and  fuel  use
taxes;  bond  proceeds;  automobile  registration  fees;  and  other  revenues  that  are  used  for  transportation
purposes, including highway and passenger rail construction and transportation safety programs.

64

Notes to the Financial Statements

Proprietary  fund  types  focus  on  the  determination  of  operating  income,  changes  in  net  assets,  financial
position, and cash flows.

Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating revenues
and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with
a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. Operating expenses include the cost of sales and services,
administrative  expenses,  and  depreciation  on  capital  assets.  All  revenues  and  expenses  not  meeting  this
definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.

For its proprietary funds, the State applies all applicable GASB pronouncements. In addition, the State applies
all  applicable  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  Statements  and  Interpretations,  Accounting
Principles  Board  (APB)  Opinions,  and  Committee  on  Accounting  Procedure  (CAP)  Accounting  Research
Bulletins  issued  on  or  before  November 30, 1989,  unless  these  pronouncements  conflict  with  or  contradict
GASB  pronouncements.  The  State  has  elected  not 
issued  after
November 30, 1989, for its enterprise funds.

to  apply  FASB  pronouncements 

The State has two proprietary fund types: enterprise funds and internal service funds.

Enterprise  funds  record  business-type  activity  for  which  a  fee  is  charged  to  external  users  for  goods  and
services. In addition, the State is required to report activities as enterprise funds in the context of the activity’s
principal revenue sources when any of the following criteria are met:

• The activity’s debt is secured solely by fees and charges of the activity;
(cid:129) There is a legal requirement to recover costs; or
(cid:129) The pricing policies of fees and charges are designed to recover costs.

The State reports the following major enterprise funds.

The  Electric  Power  Fund  accounts 
end-use customers.

for 

the  acquisition  and  resale  of  electric  power 

to  retail

The Water Resources Fund accounts for charges to local water districts and the sale of excess power to
public utilities.

The Public Building Construction Fund accounts for rental charges from the lease of public assets.

The  State  Lottery  Fund  accounts  for  the  sale  of  California  State  Lottery  (Lottery)  tickets  and  the  Lottery’s
payments for education.

The Unemployment Programs Fund accounts for employer and worker contributions used for payments of
unemployment insurance and disability benefits.

Nonmajor  enterprise  funds  account  for  additional  operations  that  are  financed  and  operated  in  a  manner
similar to private business enterprises.

Additionally,  the  State  reports  internal  service  funds  as  a  proprietary  fund  type  with  governmental  activity.
Internal service funds account for goods or services provided to other agencies, departments, or governments
on a cost-reimbursement basis. The goods and services provided include: architectural services, construction
and  improvements,  printing  and  procurement  services,  goods  produced  by  inmates  of  state  prisons,  data 

65

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

processing services, and administrative services related to water delivery. Internal service funds are included
in the governmental activities at the government-wide level.

Fiduciary fund types are used to account for assets held by the State. The State acts as a trustee or as an
agent  for  individuals,  private  organizations,  other  governments,  or  other  funds.  Fiduciary  funds,  including
fiduciary component units, are not included in the government-wide financial statements.

The State has the following four fiduciary fund types.

Private purpose trust funds account for all trust arrangements, other than those properly reported in pension
or investment trust funds, whereby principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other
governments. The following are the State’s largest private purpose trust funds.

The  Scholarshare  Program  Trust  Fund  accounts  for  money  received  from  participants  to  fund  their
beneficiaries’ higher-education expenses at certain postsecondary educational institutions.

The  Unclaimed  Property  Fund  accounts  for  unclaimed  money  and  properties  held  in  trust  by  the  State.
Unclaimed property is remitted to the General Fund where it can be used by the State until it is claimed.

Pension and other employee benefit trust funds of the primary government and fiduciary component units
account  for  transactions,  assets,  liabilities,  and  net  assets  available  for  plan  benefits  of  the  retirement
systems and for other employee benefit programs.

An  investment  trust  fund  accounts  for  the  deposits,  withdrawals,  and  earnings  of  the  Local  Agency
Investment Fund, an external investment pool for local governments and public agencies.

Agency  funds  account  for  assets  held  by  the  State,  which  acts  as  an  agent  for  individuals,  private
organizations, or other governments. The following are the State’s largest agency funds.

The  Receipting  and  Disbursing  Fund  accounts  for  the  collection  and  disbursement  of  revenues  and
receipts on behalf of local governments. This fund also accounts for receipts from numerous state funds,
typically  for  the  purpose  of  writing  a  single  warrant  when  the  warrant  is  funded  by  multiple  funding
sources.

The  Deposit  Fund  accounts  for  various  deposits,  such  as  those  from  condemnation  and  litigation
proceedings.

The Departmental Trust Fund accounts for various deposits held in trust by state departments.

Discretely  presented  component  units  consist  of  certain  organizations  that  have  enterprise  activity.  The
enterprise activity component units are the University of California, the State Compensation Insurance Fund,
the California Housing Finance Agency, the Public Employees’ Benefits Fund, and nonmajor component units.
In this report, all of the enterprise activity of the discretely presented component units is reported in a separate
column  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements  and  on  separate  pages  following  the  fund  financial
statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements

C. Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting

1. Government-wide Financial Statements

The  government-wide  financial  statements  are  reported  using  the  economic  resources  measurement  focus
and  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  Revenues  are  recorded  when  they  are  earned  and  expenses  are
recorded  when  a  liability  is  incurred,  regardless  of  the  timing  of  related  cash  flows.  Grants  and  similar
transactions are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have
been met.

2. Fund Financial Statements

The measurement focus and basis of accounting for the fund financial statements vary with the type of fund.
Governmental fund types are presented using the current financial resources measurement focus. With this
measurement  focus,  operating  statements  present  increases  and  decreases  in  net  current  assets;  the
unreserved fund balance is a measure of available spendable resources.

The  accounts  of  the  governmental  fund  types  are  reported  using  the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting.
Under  the  modified  accrual  basis,  revenues  are  recorded  as  they  become  measurable  and  available,  and
expenditures  are  recorded  at  the  time  the  liabilities  are  incurred.  The  State  records  revenue  sources  when
they  are  earned  or  when  they  are  due,  provided  they  are  measurable  and  available  within  the  ensuing
12 months.  Principal  tax  revenues  susceptible  to  accrual  are  recorded  as  taxpayers  earn  income  (personal
income  and  corporation  taxes),  as  sales  are  made  (consumption  and  use  taxes),  and  as  the  taxable  event
occurs (miscellaneous taxes), net of estimated tax overpayments.

Proprietary fund types, the investment trust fund, private purpose trust funds, and pension and other
employee benefit trust funds are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus. Agency
funds are custodial in nature and do not measure the results of operations.

The accounts of the proprietary fund types, the investment trust fund, private purpose trust funds, pension and
other  employee  benefit  trust  funds,  and  agency  funds  are  reported  using  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.
Under the accrual basis, most transactions are recorded when they occur, regardless of when cash is received
or disbursed.

Lottery  revenue  and  the  related  prize  expenses  are  recognized  when  sales  are  made.  Certain  prizes  are
payable  in  deferred  installments.  Such  liabilities  are  recorded  at  the  present  value  of  amounts  payable  in
the future.

For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, all cash and pooled investments in the State Treasurer’s pooled
investment program are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Discretely presented component units are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus
and the accrual basis of accounting.

D. Inventories

Inventories of supplies are reported at cost and inventories held for resale are stated at the lower of average
cost  or  market.  In  the  government-wide  financial  statements,  inventories  for  both  governmental  and
business-type  activities  are  expensed  when  they  are  consumed  and  unused  inventories  are  reported  as  an
asset on the Statement of Net Assets. In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report inventories
as expenditures when purchased, and proprietary funds report inventories as expenditures when consumed.
The discretely presented component units have inventory policies similar to those of the primary government.

E. Deposits and Investments

The  State  reports  investments  at  fair  value,  as  prescribed  by  GAAP.  Additional  information  on  the  State’s
investments can be found in Note 3, Deposits and Investments.

F. Net Investment in Direct Financing Leases

The State Public Works Board, an agency that accounts for its activities as an enterprise fund, has entered
into lease-purchase agreements with various other primary government agencies, the University of California,
and  certain  local  agencies.  The  payments  from  these  leases  are  used  to  satisfy  the  principal  and  interest
requirements of revenue bonds issued by the State Public Works Board to finance the cost of projects such as
acquisition and construction of facilities and equipment. Upon expiration of these leases, title to the facilities
and projects transfers to the primary government agency, the University of California, or the local agency. The
State Public Works Board records the net investment in direct financing leases at the net present value of the
minimum lease payments.

The California State University (CSU), an agency that accounts for its lease activities in the State University
Dormitory Building Maintenance and Equipment Fund, a nonmajor enterprise fund, has entered into 30-year
capital  lease  agreements  with  certain  of  its  auxiliary  organizations  that  are  accounted  for  as  a  nonmajor
discretely presented component unit. These agreements lease existing and newly constructed facilities to the
auxiliary  organizations.  A  portion  of  the  proceeds  from  certain  revenue  bonds  issued  by  CSU  were  used  to
finance the construction of these facilities.

G. Deferred Charges

The deferred charges account in the enterprise funds primarily represents operating and maintenance costs
and  unrecovered  capital  costs  that  will  be  recognized  in  the  Water  Resources  Fund  as  expenses  over  the
remaining life of long-term state water supply contracts. These costs are billable in future years. In addition,
the  account  includes  unbilled  interest  earnings  on  unrecovered  capital  costs  that  are  recorded  as  deferred
charges. These charges are recognized when billed in future years under the terms of water supply contracts.
The  deferred  charges  for  the  Public  Buildings  Construction  Fund  include  bond  counsel  fees,  trustee  fees,
rating  agency  fees,  underwriting  costs,  insurance  costs,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Bond  issuance  costs
are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  term  of  the  bonds.  Amortization  of  bond  issue  costs
during the facility construction period is capitalized and included in the construction costs. Deferred charges
are also included in the State Lottery Fund and nonmajor enterprise funds. Bond issuance costs recorded as
expenditures in governmental funds are reclassified as deferred charges in the governmental activities column
of the Statement of Net Assets and are amortized over the life of the bonds.

Notes to the Financial Statements

H. Capital Assets

Capital  assets  are  categorized  into  land,  state  highway  infrastructure,  collections,  buildings  and  other
depreciable  property,  intangible  assets,  and  construction  in  progress.  The  buildings  and  other  depreciable
property account includes buildings, improvements other than buildings, equipment, personal property, certain
infrastructure assets, certain books, and other capitalized and depreciable property. Intangible assets include
computer  software,  land  use  rights,  patents,  copyrights,  and  trademarks.  The  value  of  the  capital  assets,
including the related accumulated depreciation and amortization, is reported in the applicable governmental,
business-type, or component unit activities columns in the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.

The primary government has a large collection of historical and contemporary treasures that have important
documentary  and  artistic  value.  These  assets  are  not  capitalized  or  depreciated  because  they  are  cultural
resources and cannot reasonably be valued and/or the assets have inexhaustible useful lives. These treasures
and  works  of  art  include  furnishings,  portraits  and  other  paintings,  books,  statues,  photographs,  and
miscellaneous artifacts. These collections meet the conditions for exemption from capitalization because the
collections are: held for public exhibition, education, or research in furtherance of public service, rather than
financial gain; protected, kept unencumbered, cared for, and preserved; and are subject to an organizational
policy  that  requires  the  proceeds  from  sales  of  collection  items  to  be  used  to  acquire  other  items  for
collections.

In general, capital assets of the primary government are defined as assets that have a normal useful life of at
least  one  year  and  a  unit  cost  of  at  least  $5,000.  These  assets  are  recorded  at  historical  cost  or  estimated
historical  cost,  including  all  costs  related  to  the  acquisition.  Donated  capital  assets  are  recorded  at  the  fair
market  value  on  the  date  the  gift  was  received.  Major  capital  asset  outlays  are  capitalized  as  projects  are
constructed.

Buildings and other depreciable or amortizable capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method
with  no  salvage  value  for  governmental  activities.  Generally,  buildings  and  other  improvements  are
depreciated over 40 years, equipment is depreciated over five years, and intangible assets are amortized over
10  to  20  years.  Depreciable  or  amortizable  assets  of  business-type  activities  are  depreciated  or  amortized
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful or service lives, ranging from three to 100 years.

California  has  elected  to  use  the  modified  approach  for  capitalizing  the  infrastructure  assets  of  the  state
highway  system.  The  state  highway  system  consists  of  49,477  lane-miles  and  12,322  bridges  that  are
maintained by the California Department of Transportation. By using the modified approach, the infrastructure
assets of the state highway system are not depreciated and all expenditures made for those assets, except for
additions and improvements, are expensed in the period incurred. All additions and improvements made after
June  30,  2001,  are  capitalized.  All  infrastructure  assets  that  are  related  to  projects  completed  prior  to
July 1, 2001, are recorded at the historical costs contained in annual reports of the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration.

The capital assets of the discretely presented component units are reported at cost at the date of acquisition or
at fair market value at the date of donation, in the case of gifts. They are depreciated or amortized over their
estimated useful service lives.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

I. Long-term Obligations

Long-term  obligations  consist  of  certain  unmatured  general  obligation  bonds,  certain  unmatured  revenue
bonds, capital lease obligations, certificates of participation, commercial paper, the net pension obligation of
the  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds,  the  net  other  postemployment  benefits  obligation,  the
liability  for  employees’  compensated  absences  and  workers’  compensation  claims,  pollution  remediation
obligations,  amounts  owed  for  lawsuits,  reimbursement  for  costs  mandated  by  the  State,  the  outstanding
Proposition  98  funding  guarantee  owed  to  schools,  the  liability  for  Lottery  prizes  and  annuities,  loans  from
other  governments  and  fiduciary  funds,  and  the  primary  government’s  share  of  the  University  of  California
pension liability that is due in more than one year. In the government-wide financial statements, current and
noncurrent  obligations  are  reported  as  liabilities  in  the  applicable  governmental  activities,  business-type
activities, and component units columns of the Statement of Net Assets.

Pollution remediation obligations are recorded by the State when one or more of the GASB Statement No. 49
obligating events have occurred and when a reasonable estimate of the remediation cost is available. These
liabilities are measured using actual contract costs, where no change in cost is expected, or the expected cash
flow technique. The remediation obligation estimates that appear in this report are subject to change over time.
Cost  may  vary  due  to  price  fluctuations,  changes  in  technology,  changes  in  potential  responsible  parties,
results  of  environmental  studies,  changes  to  statutes  or  regulations  and  other  factors  that  could  result  in
revisions  to  these  estimates.  Prospective  recoveries  from  responsible  parties  may  reduce  the  State’s
obligation.  

Bond  premiums,  discounts,  and  loss  on  refundings  for  business-type  activities  and  component  units  are
generally deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds. In these instances, bonds payable are reported
net of the applicable premium, discount, or loss. Bond premiums and discounts for governmental activities are
reported as other financing sources (uses) in the fund financial statements. However, in the government-wide
financial  statements,  the  bonds  payable  for  governmental  activities  is  reported  net  of  the  applicable
unamortized premium, discount, and loss on refundings.

With  approval  in  advance  from  the  Legislature,  certain  authorities  and  state  agencies  may  issue  revenue
bonds.  Principal  and  interest  on  revenue  bonds  are  payable  from  the  pledged  revenues  of  the  respective
funds, building authorities, and agencies. The General Fund has no legal liability for payment of principal and
interest on revenue bonds. With the exception of certain special revenue funds (Transportation and the Golden
State  Tobacco  Securitization  Corporation)  and  the  building  authorities’  capital  projects  funds,  the  liability  for
revenue bonds is recorded in the respective fund.

J. Compensated Absences

The  government-wide  financial  statements  report  both  the  current  and  the  noncurrent  liabilities  for
compensated  absences,  which  are  vested  unpaid  vacation,  annual  leave,  and  other  paid  leave  programs.
However,  unused  sick-leave  balances  are  not  included  in  the  compensated  absences  because  they  do  not
vest to employees. In the fund financial statements for governmental funds, only the compensated absences
for employees that have left state service and have unused reimbursable leave at year-end would be included.
The  amounts  of  vested  unpaid  vacation  and  annual  leave  accumulated  by  state  employees  are  accrued  in
proprietary funds when incurred. In the discretely presented component units, the compensated absences are
accounted for in the same manner as in the proprietary funds of the primary government.

70

Notes to the Financial Statements

K. Net Assets and Fund Balance

The  difference  between  fund  assets  and  liabilities  is  called  “net  assets”  on  the  government-wide  financial
statements, the proprietary and fiduciary fund statements, and the component unit statements; it is called “fund
balance” on the governmental fund statements. The government-wide financial statements have the following
categories of net assets.

Investment in capital assets, net of related debt, represents capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation,
reduced  by  the  outstanding  principal  balances  of  debt  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  construction,  or
improvement of those assets.

Restricted  net  assets  result  from  transactions  with  purpose  restrictions  and  are  designated  as  either
nonexpendable  or  expendable.  Nonexpendable  restricted  net  assets  are  subject  to  externally  imposed
restrictions  that  must  be  retained  in  perpetuity.  Expendable  restricted  net  assets  are  subject  to  externally
imposed restrictions that can be fulfilled by actions of the State. As of June 30, 2010, the government-wide 
financial  statements  show  restricted  net  assets  for  the  primary  government  of  $18.4  billion,  of  which
$2.3 billion is due to enabling legislation.

Unrestricted net assets are neither restricted nor invested in capital assets, net of related debt.

In  the  fund  financial  statements,  proprietary  funds  have  categories  of  net  assets  similar  to  those  in  the
government-wide statements. Governmental funds have two fund balance sections: reserved and unreserved.
Part  or  all  of  the  total  fund  balance  may  be  reserved  as  a  result  of  law  or  generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Reserves represent those portions of the fund balances that are segregated for specific uses. The
reserves of the fund balance for governmental funds are as follows.

Reserved for encumbrances represents goods and services that are ordered, but not received, by the end of
the fiscal year.

Reserved for interfund receivables represents the noncurrent portion of advances to other funds that do not
represent expendable available financial resources.

Reserved for loans receivable represents the noncurrent portion of loans receivable that does not represent
expendable available financial resources.

Reserved for continuing appropriations represents the unencumbered balance of all appropriations for which
the period of availability extends beyond the period covered in the report. These appropriations are legally
segregated for a specific future use.

Reserved for debt service represents the amount legally reserved for the payment of bonded indebtedness
that is not available for other purposes until the bonded indebtedness is liquidated.

The unreserved amounts represent the net of total fund balance, less reserves.

Fiduciary fund net assets are amounts held in trust for benefits and other purposes.

L. Restatement of Beginning Fund Balances and Net Assets

1. Fund Financial Statements

The  beginning  fund  balance  of  the  governmental  funds  increased  by  $1.5  billion.  The  net  increase  is
comprised  of  a  $38  million  decrease  in  the  Environmental  and  Natural  Resources  Fund,  a  nonmajor
governmental  fund,  as  a  result  of  a  correction  of  prior  year  capitalization  of  grant  revenue;  a  $1  million
increase  in  the  Trial  Courts  Fund,  a  nonmajor  governmental  fund,  as  a  result  of  a  prior  year  error  in
accounting for capital assets; and a $1.5 billion increase in the Financing for Local Government and the Public
Fund,  a nonmajor governmental fund,  as  a  result  of  the  inclusion  of  grant  and  loan  commitments  in  prior
year expenditures.

The beginning net assets of the pension and other employee benefit trust funds increased by $238 million
as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  GASB  Statement  No.  51,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  for
Intangible Assets, in the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund.

The beginning net assets of the discretely presented component units—enterprise activity decreased by
$38  million.  The  decrease  comprises  a  $19  million  net  decrease  in  the  California  State  University  auxiliary
organizations  as  a  result  of  error  corrections  and  a  change  in  accounting  policy  for  capital  assets  and  a
$19 million  decrease  in  the  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  Fund  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of
GASB Statement No. 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments.

2. Government-wide Financial Statements

The beginning net assets of the governmental activities increased by $1.6 billion. In addition to the amounts
described in the previous section for governmental funds, the restatement comprises a $20 million decrease to
reflect a revenue bond that was previously omitted; a $32 million increase to adjust the other postemployment
benefits  obligation;  a  $50  million  increase  to  adjust  pollution  remediation  obligations;  and  an  $81  million
increase to capital assets as a result of implementing GASB Statement No. 51.

The  beginning  net  assets  of  the  component  units  were  restated  as  described  in  the  previous  section  for
discretely presented component units—enterprise activity.

M. Guaranty Deposits

The  State  is  custodian  of  guaranty  deposits  held  to  protect  consumers,  to  secure  the  State’s  deposits  in
financial  institutions,  and  to  ensure  payment  of  taxes  and  fulfillment  of  obligations  to  the  State.  Guaranty
deposits of securities and other properties are not shown on the financial statements.

72

Notes to the Financial Statements

NOTE 2:  BUDGETARY AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

A. Budgeting and Budgetary Control

The  State’s  annual  budget  is  prepared  primarily  on  a  modified  accrual  basis  for  governmental  funds.  The
Governor  recommends  a  budget  for  approval  by  the  Legislature  each  year.  This  recommended  budget
includes  estimated  revenues;  however,  revenues  are  not  included  in  the  annual  budget  bill  adopted  by  the
Legislature.  Under  state  law,  the  State  cannot  adopt  a  spending  plan  that  exceeds  estimated  revenues.

Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the treasury only through a legal appropriation. The
appropriations contained in the Budget Act, as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor, are
the primary sources of annual expenditure authorizations and establish the legal level of control for the annual
operating  budget.  The  budget  can  be  amended  throughout  the  year  by  special  legislative  action,  budget
revisions  by  the  Department  of  Finance,  or  executive  orders  of  the  Governor.  Amendments  to  the  original
budget for the year ended June 30, 2010, were legally made, and they had the effect of decreased spending
for the General Fund and the Transportation Fund.

Appropriations are generally available for expenditure or encumbrance either in the year appropriated or for a
period  of  three  years  if  the  legislation  does  not  specify  a  period  of  availability.  At  the  end  of  the  availability
period,  the  encumbering  authority  for  the  unencumbered  balance  lapses.  Some  appropriations  continue
indefinitely,  while  others  are  available  until  fully  spent.  Generally,  encumbrances  must  be  liquidated  within
two years  from  the  end  of  the  period  in  which  the  appropriation  is  available.  If  the  encumbrances  are  not
liquidated within this additional two-year period, the spending authority for these encumbrances lapses.

B. Legal Compliance

State agencies are responsible for exercising basic budgetary control and ensuring that appropriations are not
overspent.  The  State  Controller’s  Office  is  responsible  for  overall  appropriation  control  and  does  not  allow
expenditures in excess of authorized appropriations.

Financial activities are mainly controlled at the appropriation level but can vary, depending on the presentation
and  wording  contained  in  the  Budget  Act.  The  Budget  Act  appropriations  are  identified  by  department,
reference  item,  and  fund.  The  annual  appropriated  budget  may  establish  detailed  allocations  to  specific
programs,  projects,  or  sources  of  reimbursement  within  an  appropriation.  The  Department  of  Finance  can
authorize  adjustments  between  the  detail  allocations  but  cannot  increase  the  amount  of  the  overall
appropriation.  While  the  financial  activities  are  controlled  at  various  levels,  the  legal  level  of  budgetary
control—the extent to which management may amend the budget without seeking approval of the governing
body—has been established in the Budget Act for the annual operating budget.

73

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

NOTE 3:  DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS

The State Treasurer administers a single pooled investment program comprising both an internal investment
pool and an external investment pool (the Local Agency Investment Fund). A single portfolio of investments
exists,  with  all  participants  having  an  undivided  interest  in  the  portfolio.  Both  pools  are  administered  in  the
same manner, as described below.

As required by generally accepted accounting principles, certain risk disclosures are included in this note to
the  extent  that  the  risks  exist  at  the  date  of  the  statement  of  net  assets.  Disclosure  of  the  following  risks  is
included:

Interest  Rate  Risk  is  the  risk  that  the  value  of  fixed-income  securities  will  decline  because  of  changing
interest rates. The prices of fixed-income securities with longer time to maturity tend to be more sensitive to
changes in interest rates than those with shorter durations.

Credit  Risk  is  the  risk  that  a  debt  issuer  will  fail  to  pay  interest  or  principal  in  a  timely  manner,  or  that
negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make these payments will cause security prices to decline.

Custodial Credit Risk is the risk that, in the event a financial institution or counterparty fails, the investor will
not be able to recover the value of deposits, investments, or collateral.

Concentration  of  Credit  Risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  attributed  to  the  magnitude  of  an  investor’s  holdings  in  a
single issuer.

Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment or a deposit.

A. Primary Government

The  State’s  pooled  investment  program  and  certain  funds  of  the  primary  government  are  allowed  by  state
statutes, bond resolutions, and investment policy resolutions to invest in United States government securities,
federal  agency  securities,  negotiable  certificates  of  deposit,  bankers’  acceptances,  commercial  paper,
corporate bonds, bank notes, other debt securities, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements,
and other investments.

Certain  discretely  presented  component  units  participate  in  the  State  Treasurer’s  Office  pooled  investment
program. As of June 30, 2010, the discretely presented component units accounted for approximately 3.9% of
the  State  Treasurer’s  pooled  investment  portfolio.  This  program  enables  the  State  Treasurer’s  Office  to
combine available cash from all funds and to invest cash that exceeds current needs.

Both deposits and investments are included in the State’s investment program. For certain banks, the State
Treasurer’s Office maintains cash deposits that cover uncleared checks deposited in the State’s accounts and
that earn income which compensates the banks for their services.

Demand  and  time  deposits  held  by  financial  institutions  as  of  June 30,  2010,  totaling  approximately
$5.7 billion, were insured by federal depository insurance or by collateral held by the State Treasurer’s Office
or an agent of the State Treasurer’s Office in the State’s name. The California Government Code requires that
collateral pledged for demand and time deposits be deposited with the State Treasurer.

74

Notes to the Financial Statements

As  of  June 30,  2010,  the  State  Treasurer’s  Office  had  on  deposit  with  a  fiscal  agent  amounts  totaling
$30 million related to principal and interest payments to bondholders. These deposits were insured by federal
depository insurance or by collateral held by an agent of the State Treasurer’s Office in the State’s name.

The  State  Treasurer’s  Office  reports  its  investments  at  fair  value.  The  fair  value  of  securities  in  the  State
Treasurer’s  pooled  investment  program  generally  is  based  on  quoted  market  prices.  The  State  Treasurer’s
Office performs a quarterly fair market valuation of the pooled investment program portfolio. In addition, the
State Treasurer’s Office performs a monthly fair market valuation of all securities held against carrying cost.
These  valuations  are  posted  to  the  State  Treasurer’s  Office  Web  site  at  www.treasurer.ca.gov.  As  of
June 30, 2010, the weighted average maturity of the securities in the pooled investment program administered
by  the  State  Treasurer’s  Office  was  approximately  201  days.  Weighted  average  maturity  is  the  average
number  of  days,  given  a  dollar-weighted  value  of  individual  investments,  that  the  securities  in  the  portfolio
have remaining from evaluation date to stated maturity.

The Pooled Money Investment Board provides oversight of the State Treasurer’s pooled investment program.
The  purpose  of  the  board  is  to  design  an  effective  cash  management  and  investment  program,  using  all
monies flowing through the State Treasurer’s Office bank accounts and keeping all available funds invested in
a  manner  consistent  with  the  goals  of  safety,  liquidity,  and  yield.  The  Pooled  Money  Investment  Board  is
comprised  of  the  State  Treasurer  as  chair,  the  State  Controller,  and  the  Director  of  Finance.  This  board
designates the amounts of money available for investment. The State Treasurer is charged with making the
actual investment transactions for this program. This investment program is not registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission as an investment company.

The  value  of  the  deposits  in  the  State  Treasurer’s  pooled  investment  program,  including  the  Local  Agency
Investment Fund, is equal to the dollars deposited in the program. The fair value of the position in the program
may be greater or less than the value of the deposits, with the difference representing the unrealized gain or
loss. As of June 30, 2010, this difference was immaterial to the valuation of the program. The pool is run with
“dollar-in, dollar-out” participation. There are no share-value adjustments to reflect changes in fair value. 

Certain  funds  have  elected  to  participate  in  the  pooled  investment  program  even  though  they  have  the
authority to make their own investments. Others may be required by legislation to participate in the program;
as a result, the deposits of these funds or accounts may be considered involuntary. However, these funds or
accounts  are  part  of  the  State’s  reporting  entity.  The  remaining  participation  in  the  pool,  the  Local  Agency
Investment Fund, is voluntary.

Certain  funds  that  have  deposits  in  the  State  Treasurer’s  pooled  investment  program  do  not  receive  the
interest  earnings  on  their  deposits.  Instead,  by  law,  the  earnings  are  to  be  assigned  to  the  State’s  General
Fund. Most of the $42 million in interest revenue received by the General Fund from the pooled investment
program in the 2009-10 fiscal year was earned on balances in these funds.

The  State  Treasurer’s  pooled  investment  program  values  participants’  shares  on  an  amortized  cost  basis.
Specifically,  the  program  distributes  income  to  participants  quarterly,  based  on  their  relative  participation
during  the  quarter.  This  participation  is  calculated  based  on  (1) realized  investment  gains  and  losses
calculated  on  an  amortized  cost  basis,  (2) interest  income  based  on  stated  rates  (both  paid  and  accrued),
(3) amortization  of  discounts  and  premiums  on  a  straight-line  basis,  and  (4) investment  and  administrative
expenses. This amortized cost method differs from the fair value method used to value investments in these
financial  statements;  the  amortized  cost  method  is  not  designed  to  distribute  to  participants  all  unrealized
gains and losses in the fair value of the pool’s investments. Because the total difference between the fair value
of the investments in the pool and the value distributed to pool participants using the amortized cost method
described above is not material, no adjustment was made to the financial statements.

75

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The State Treasurer’s Office also reports participant fair value as a ratio of amortized cost on a quarterly basis.
The State Treasurer’s Office has not provided or obtained a legally binding guarantee to support the principal
invested in the investment program.

As  of  June  30,  2010,  structured  notes  and  medium-term  asset-backed  securities  comprised  approximately
2.6%  of  the  pooled  investments.  A  significant  portion  of  the  structured  notes  consisted  of  federal  agency
floating-rate  debentures.  For  the  federal  agency  and  corporate  floating-rate  securities  held  in  the  portfolio
during the fiscal year, the interest received by the State Treasurer’s pooled investment program rose or fell as
the  underlying  index  rate  rose  or  fell.  The  portion  representing  the  asset-backed  securities  consists  of
mortgage backed securities, Small Business Administration (SBA) pools, and asset-backed commercial paper.
The  mortgage-backed  securities  are  called  real  estate  mortgage  investment  conduits  (REMICs),  and  are
securities backed by pools of mortgages. The REMICs in the State’s portfolio have a fixed principal payment
schedule. A lesser portion of the asset-backed securities consisted of floating-rate SBA notes. For floating-rate
SBA  notes  held  in  the  portfolio  during  the  fiscal  year,  the  interest  received  by  the  State Treasurer’s  pooled
investment program rose or fell as the underlying index rate rose or fell. The structure of the floating-rate notes
in the State Treasurer’s pooled investment program portfolio provided a hedge against the risk of increasing
interest rates. A portion of the asset-backed portfolio holdings was short-term, asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP), which represented 2.8% of pooled investments.

Enterprise  funds  and  special  revenue  funds  also  make  separate  investments,  which  are  presented  at  fair
value.

Limitations are pursuant to the State Treasurer’s Office Investment Policy for the Pooled Money Investment Account. The 
Government  Code does not establish limits for investments of surplus monies in this investment type, except for commercial paper.
The State Treasurer’s Office Investment Policy for the Pooled Money Investment Account is more restrictive than the
Government Code, which allows investments rated A-3/P-3/F-3.
The Government Code requires that a security fall within the top three ratings of a nationally recognized rating service.

Neither the Government Code nor the State Treasure’s Office Investment Policy for the Pooled Money Investment Account 
sets limits for the investment of surplus monies in this investment type.

These  mortgage-backed  securities  entitle  the  purchaser  to  receive  a  share  of  the  cash  flows,  such  as  principal  and  interest
payments, from a pool of mortgages. Mortgage securities are sensitive to interest rate changes because principal prepayments
either increase (in a low interest rate environment) or decrease (in a high interest rate environment). A change, up or down, in
the payment rate will result in a change in the security yield.

The State Treasurer’s Office uses Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch ratings services. Securities are classified by the lowest
rating of the three agencies.
Total pooled investments does not include certain assets of the State’s pooled investment program. The other assets include time
deposits of $4.1 billion, for which credit risk is mitigated by collateral that the State holds for them—as discussed earlier in this
note—and  $7.5  billion  in  loans  to  state  funds,  primarily  to  the  General  Fund,  for  which  external  credit  risk  is  not  applicable
because they are internal loans.

invested  in  any  one  issuer  beyond  those  limitations  stipulated  in  the  California  Government  Code.  Table  5
identifies debt securities in any one issuer (other than U.S. Treasury securities) that represent 5% or more of
the State Treasurer’s investments, or of the separate investments of other primary government funds.

4. Custodial Credit Risk

institutions  to  be  insured  by  federal  depository  insurance  or  secured  by  collateral.  As  of  June  30,  2010,
$4 million in deposits of the Electric Power Fund were uninsured and uncollateralized.

81

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

B. Fiduciary Funds

The fiduciary funds include pension and other employee benefit trust funds of the following fiduciary funds and
component  units:  the  California  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  (CalPERS),  the  California  State
Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), the fund for the California Scholarshare program, and various other
funds. CalPERS and CalSTRS account for 97% of these separately invested funds. CalPERS and CalSTRS
exercise their authority under the State Constitution and invest in stocks, bonds, mortgages, real estate, and
other investments, including derivative instruments.

CalPERS  reports  investments  in  securities  at  fair  value,  generally  based  on  published  market  prices  and
quotations from pricing vendors. Many factors are considered in arriving at fair value. Real estate investments
are held either directly, in separate accounts, or as a limited partnership or in a joint venture or commingled
fund.  Properties  owned  directly  or  in  a  joint  venture  are  subject  to  independent  third-party  appraisals.
Short-term investments are reported at market value, when available, or, when market value is not available,
at  cost  plus  accrued  interest,  which  approximates  market  value.  For  investments  where  no  readily
ascertainable market value exists, management, in consultation with its investment advisors, determines the
fair values for the individual investments.

CalSTRS also reports investments at fair value, generally based on published market prices and quotations
from  pricing  vendors  for  securities.  Real  estate  equity  investment  fair  values  are  based  on  either  recent
estimates  provided  by  CalSTRS’  contract  real  estate  advisors  or  by  independent  appraisers.  Short-term
investments are reported at fair value or at cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value. For short-
term investments which are reported at fair value, the investments are valued using similar methodologies as
used  for  debt  securities.  Fair  value  for  commingled  funds  (other  than  those  funds  traded  on  a  national  or
international  exchange)  is  based  on  information  provided  by  the  applicable  fund  managers.  Private  Equity
partnerships  are  valued  using  their  respective  Net  Asset  Value  (NAV),  and  are  audited  annually.  The  most
significant input into the NAV of such an entity is the fair value of its investment holdings. These holdings are
valued  by  the  general  partners  on  a  quarterly  or  semi-annual  basis,  in  conjunction  with  management  and
investment advisors. For private equity investments and other investments for which no readily ascertainable
market value exists, CalSTRS management, in consultation with its investment advisors, has determined the
fair value for the individual investments. Purchases and sales are recorded on the trade date.

The  State  Constitution,  state  statutes,  and  board  policies  permit  CalPERS  and  CalSTRS  to  lend  their
securities  to  broker-dealers  and  other  entities  with  a  simultaneous  agreement  to  return  the  collateral  for  the
same  securities  in  the  future.  Third-party  securities  lending  agents  are  under  contract  to  lend  domestic  and
international  equity  and  debt  securities.  For  both  CalPERS  and  CalSTRS,  collateral,  in  the  form  of  cash  or
other  securities,  is  required  at  102%  and  105%  of  the  fair  value  of  domestic  and  international  securities
loaned, respectively. CalPERS’ management believes that CalPERS has minimized its credit risk exposure by
requiring the borrowers to provide collateral greater than 100% of the market value of the securities loaned.
The securities loaned are priced daily. Securities on loan can be recalled on demand by CalPERS and loans
of securities may be terminated by CalPERS or the borrower. 

As of June 30, 2010, certain collateral reinvestments did not comply with CalPERS investment guidelines due
to certain enforcement actions. In addition, credit rating for certain collateral reinvestments did not comply with
the  investment  guidelines  due  to  credit  quality  downgrades  occurring  in  2009-10  and  prior  fiscal  years.
Management  is  monitoring  the  collateral  reinvestments  for  opportunities  to  maximize  those  investments.  At
June 30, 2010, the cash collateral had weighted average maturities of 48, 1,634, 111, 219 and 38 days for two
externally  managed  and  three  internally  managed  portfolios.  The  large  weighted  average  maturity  in  one
externally managed collateral pool is attributed to two Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) within the pool.

82

Notes to the Financial Statements

CalPERS has incurred an unrealized loss of approximately $554 million as a result of marking the SIVs’ value
down to current fair value as of June 30, 2010. 

For CalSTRS, collateral received on each security loan was placed in investments that, at June 30, 2010, had
a  26-day  difference  in  weighted  average  maturity  between  the  investments  and  loans.  Most  of  CalSTRS’
security loans can be terminated on demand by CalSTRS or the borrower. CalSTRS is not permitted to pledge
or  sell  collateral  securities  received  unless  the  borrower  defaults.  The  contracts  with  the  security  lending
agents require them to indemnify CalSTRS if the borrowers fail to return the securities (or if the collateral is not
sufficient to replace the securities lent) or if the borrowers fail to pay CalSTRS for income distributions by the
securities’ issuers while the securities are on loan.

* Debt securities include short-term investments not included in cash and pooled investments.

1. Interest Rate Risk

CalPERS and CalSTRS manage the interest rate risk inherent in their investment portfolios by measuring the
effective or option-adjusted duration of the portfolio. In using the duration method, these agencies may make
assumptions regarding the timing of cash flows or other factors that affect interest rate risk information. The
CalPERS  investment  policies  require  the  option-adjusted  duration  of  the  total  fixed-income  portfolio  to  stay
within  20%  of  the  option-adjusted  duration  of  its  benchmark  (Barclay’s  Long  Liability  Index).  All  individual
portfolios  are  required  to  maintain  a  specific  level  of  risk  relative  to  their  benchmark.  Risk  exposures  are
monitored daily. The CalSTRS investment guidelines allow the core long-term investment grade portfolios the
discretion to deviate within plus or minus 20% (0.80 to 1.20) of the weighted average effective duration of the
relevant Barclay’s Capital benchmark. The permissible range of deviation for the weighted average effective
duration within the opportunistic strategy portfolios is negotiated with each manager and detailed within their
respective investment guidelines. The CalSTRS investment guidelines state that the average maturity of the
short-term fixed-income portfolio shall be managed such that it will not exceed 180 days.

2. Credit Risk

The  CalPERS  investment  policies  require  that  80%  of  the  total  fixed-income  portfolio  be  invested  in
investment-grade  securities.  Investment-grade  securities  are  those  fixed-income  securities  with  a  Moody’s
rating of AAA to BAA or a Standard and Poor’s rating of AAA to BBB. Each portfolio is required to maintain a
specified risk level. Portfolio exposures are monitored daily. The CalSTRS investment guidelines require that,
at  the  time  of  purchase,  at  least  95%  of  the  corporate  securities  comprising  the  credit  portion  of  the  core
fixed-income  portfolio  be  rated  Baa3/BBB-/BBB-  or  better  by  two  out  of  the  three  nationally  recognized
statistical rating organizations (NRSROs), such as Moody’s Investors Service, Inc, Standard and Poor’s Rating
Service,  or  Fitch  Ratings.  Furthermore,  the  total  position  of  the  outstanding  debt  of  any  one  private
mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities  issuer  shall  be  limited  to  10%  of  the  market  value  of  the
portfolio. Obligations of other issuers are held to a 5% per issuer limit (at the time of purchase) of the market
value  of  any  individual  portfolio.  The  investment  guidelines  also  include  an  allocation  to  opportunistic
strategies,  a  portion  of  which  are  managed  externally  and  allow  for  the  purchase  of  bonds  rated  below
investment grade. Limitations on the amount of debt of any one issuer a manager may hold are negotiated on
a manager-by-manager basis.

Table 8 presents the credit risk of the fixed-income securities of these fiduciary funds.

Notes to the Financial Statements

3. Concentration of Credit Risk

The Deferred Compensation Plan Fund held $1.4 billion in investment contracts of Dwight Asset Management
Company;  this  amount  represented  20.7%  of  the  fund’s  total  investments  as  of  June  30,  2010.  The
Scholarshare  Program  Trust  Fund  held  $234  million  in  investment  contracts  of  TIAA-CREF  Life  Insurance
Company; this amount represented 6.5% of the fund’s total investments as of June 30, 2010.

CalPERS and CalSTRS did not have investments in a single issuer that represented 5% or more of total fair
value of all investments.

4. Custodial Credit Risk

CalPERS has policies and practices to minimize custodial risk, and its investments at June 30, 2010, were not
exposed  to  custodial  risk.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  all  of  CalSTRS  investments,  other  than  those  of  two
tax-deferred defined contribution plans amounting to $235 million held in the name of TIAA-CREF, are held in
CalSTRS’ name and/or are not exposed to custodial credit risk. CalSTRS has no general policies relating to
custodial credit risk.

5. Foreign Currency Risk

At  June  30,  2010,  CalPERS  and  CalSTRS  held  $60.3  billion  and  $24.6  billion,  respectively,  in  investments,
including  derivative  instruments,  subject  to  foreign  currency  risk.  CalPERS’  asset  allocation  and  investment
policies  allow  for  active  and  passive  investments  in  international  securities.  CalPERS’  target  allocation  is  to
have 50% of total global equity assets invested in international equities and 10% of total fixed-income invested
in  international  securities.  Real  estate  and  alternative  investments  do  not  have  a  target  allocation  for
international investment. CalPERS uses a currency overlay program to reduce risk by hedging approximately
25%  of  the  developed  market  international  equity  portfolio.  Its  currency  exposures  are  monitored  daily.
CalSTRS believes that its Currency Management Program should emphasize the protection of the value of its
non-dollar  public  and  private  equity  assets  against  a  strengthening  U.S.  dollar  first,  yet  recognizes  that
opportunities also exist for alpha generation (the ability to derive a return in excess of a market return) within
the currency markets. The hedging range has been designed to allow for some degree of symmetry around
the unhedged program benchmark in order to enable the Currency Management Program to both protect the
translation value of the assets against a strengthening U.S. dollar and to enhance returns in a declining U.S.
dollar environment. As a result, the hedging range is - 25% to 50% of the total market value of the non-dollar
public and private equity portfolios.

C. Discretely Presented Component Units

The discretely presented component units consist of the University of California and its foundations, the State
Compensation  Insurance  Fund  (SCIF),  the  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  (CalHFA),  the  Public
Employees’  Benefits  Fund  administered  by  CalPERS,  and  various  funds  that  constitute  less  than  3%  of  the
total investments of discretely presented component units. State law, bond resolutions, and investment policy
resolutions  allow  component  units  to  invest  in  U.S.  government  securities,  state  and  municipal  securities,
commercial paper, corporate bonds, investment agreements, real estate, and other investments. Additionally,
a portion of the cash and pooled investments of SCIF, CalHFA, and other component units is invested in the
State Treasurer’s pooled investment program.

The investments of the University of California, a discretely presented component unit, are primarily stated at
fair value. Investments authorized by the regents include equity securities, fixed-income securities, and certain
other asset classes. The equity portion of the investment portfolio includes domestic and foreign common and
preferred  stocks,  which  may  be  included  in  actively  or  passively  managed  strategies,  along  with  a  modest
exposure to private equities. Private equities include venture capital partnerships, buy-outs, and international
funds. The fixed-income portion of the investment portfolio may include both domestic and foreign securities,
as well as certain securitized investments including mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Absolute
return  strategies,  incorporating  short  sales,  plus  derivative  positions  to  implement  or  hedge  an  investment
position,  are  also  authorized.  Where  donor  agreements  have  placed  constraints  on  allowable  investments,
assets associated with endowments are invested in accordance with the terms of the agreements.

The  University  of  California  participates  in  a  securities  lending  program  as  a  means  to  augment  income.
Campus  foundations’  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  investments  that  are  invested  with  the  University  of
California  and  managed  by  the  university’s  treasurer  are  included  in  the  university’s  investment  pools  that
participate  in  a  securities  lending  program.  The  campus  foundations’  allocated  share  of  the  program’s  cash
collateral received, investment of cash collateral, and collateral held for securities lending is determined based
upon the foundations’ equity in the investment pools. The Board of Trustees for each campus foundation may
also authorize participation in a direct securities lending program. The university loans securities to selected
brokerage firms and receives collateral that equals or exceeds the fair value of such investments during the
period of the loan. Collateral may be cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, or the
sovereign  or  provincial  debt  of  foreign  countries.  Securities  collateral  cannot  be  pledged  or  sold  by  the
university unless the borrower defaults. Loans of domestic equities and all fixed-income securities are initially
collateralized  at  102%  of  the  fair  value  of  the  securities  loaned.  Loans  of  foreign  equities  are  initially
collateralized at 105%. All borrowers are required to provide additional collateral by the next business day if
the value falls to less than 100% of the fair value of the securities loaned. The university earns interest and
dividends  on  the  collateral  held  during  the  loan  period,  as  well  as  a  fee  from  the  brokerage  firm,  and  it  is
obligated to pay a fee and a rebate to the borrower. The university receives the net investment income. As of
June 30, 2010, the university had insignificant exposure to borrower default because the amounts that it owed
the borrowers were substantially the same as the amounts the borrowers owed the university. The university is
fully indemnified by its lending agents against any losses incurred as a result of borrower default.

Securities loans immediately terminate upon notice by either the university or the borrower. Cash collateral is
invested  by  the  university’s  lending  agents  in  short-term  investment  pools  in  the  university’s  name,  with
guidelines  approved  by  the  university.  As  of  June 30,  2010,  the  securities  in  these  pools  had  a  weighted
average maturity of 32 days.

1. Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk for the University of California’s short-term investment pool is managed by constraining the
maturity of all individual securities to be less than five and one-half years. There is no restriction on weighted
average maturity of the portfolio, as it is managed relative to the liquidity demands of the investors. Portfolio
guidelines  for  the  fixed-income  portion  of  the  university’s  general  endowment  pool  limit  weighted  average
effective duration to the effective duration of the Lehman Aggregate Index, plus or minus 20%.

SCIF guidelines provide that 15% or more of its total portfolio shall be maintained in securities maturing in five
years or less. For information about CalPERS’ policies related to interest rate risk, refer to Section B, Fiduciary
Funds.

Notes to the Financial Statements

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Table 12 identifies the debt securities that are highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations (to a greater degree
than  already  indicated  in  the  information  provided  previously)  because  of  the  existence  of  prepayment  or
conversion features, although the effective duration of these securities may be low.

Table 12

Schedule of Highly Sensitive Investments in Debt Securities – University of California and its Foundations – Interest Rate Risk
June 30, 2010
(amounts in thousands)

Mortgage-Backed Securities

These securities are primarily issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),
Government  National  Mortgage  Association  (Ginnie  Mae)  and  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage
Corporation  (Freddie  Mac)  and  include  short  embedded  prepayment  options.  Unanticipated
prepayments by the obligees of the underlying asset reduce the total expected rate of return.

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations

19,975 

2.70 

Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) generate a return based upon either the payment of
interest  or  principal  on  mortgages  in  an  underlying  pool.  The  relationship  between  interest  rates
and  prepayments  makes  the  fair  value  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  interest  rates.  In  falling
interest  rate  environments,  the  underlying  mortgages  are  subject  to  a  higher  propensity  of
prepayments. In a rising interest rate environment, the underlying mortgages are subject to a lower
propensity of prepayments.

Other Asset-Backed Securities

28,820 

0.80 

Other asset-backed securities also generate a return based upon either the payment of interest or
principal on obligations in an underlying pool, generally associated with auto loans or credit cards.
As  with  CMOs,  the  relationship  between  interest  rates  and  prepayments  makes  the  fair  value
highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Variable-Rate Securities

169,391 

0.20 

These  securities are investments with terms that provide for the adjustment of their interest rates
on set dates and are expected to have fair values that will be relatively unaffected by interest rate
changes.  Variable-rate  securities  may  have  limits  on  how  high  or  low  the  interest  may  change.
These constraints may affect the market value of the security.

Callable Bonds

1,010,098 

1.80 

Although  bonds  are  issued  with  clearly  defined  maturities,  an  issuer  may  be  able  to  redeem,  or
call, a bond earlier than its maturity date. The university must then replace the called bond with a
bond  that  may  have  a  lower  yield  than  the  original.  The  call  feature  causes  the  fair  value  to  be
highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Convertible Bonds

743 

4.40 

Convertible bonds are fixed-income securities with coupon rates that tend to be lower than those in
conventional  debt  issues.  Consequently,  an  increase  in  the  market’s  rate  of  interest  causes  a
greater decline in the price of issues of convertible bonds than that of non-convertible bonds.

Investment Derivatives

126,188 

3.30 

Forward    contracts  on  a  to-be-announced  basis  are  used  to  purchase  certain  mortgage-backed
securities when the price cannot be determined until the coupon rate is known.  These securities
have  the  same  interest  rate  risk  as  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBS).    They  were  included  as
part of MBS last year and were reclassified to comply with GASB Statement No. 53.

2. Credit Risk

The  investment  guidelines  for  the  University  of  California’s  short-term  investment  pool  provide  that  no  more
than 5% of the total market value of the pool’s portfolio may be invested in securities rated below investment
grade  (BB,  Ba,  or  lower).  The  average  credit  quality  of  the  pool  must  be  A  or  better  and  commercial  paper
must be rated at least A-1, P-1, or F-1. For its general endowment pool, the university uses a fixed-income
benchmark, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Index, comprising approximately 30% high grade corporate bonds
and  30%  to  35%  mortgage/asset-backed  securities,  all  of  which  carry  some  degree  of  credit  risk.  The
remaining  35%  to  40%  are  government-issued  bonds.  Credit  risk  in  this  pool  is  managed  primarily  by
diversifying  across  issuers,  and  portfolio  guidelines  mandate  that  no  more  than  10%  of  the  market  value  of
fixed-income  securities  may  be  invested  in  issues  with  credit  ratings  below  investment  grade.  Further,  the
weighted average credit rating must be A or higher.

SCIF  investment  guidelines  provide  that  securities  issued  and/or  guaranteed  by  the  government  of  Canada
and its political subdivisions must be rated Aa3/AA- or better by two nationally recognized rating services.  No
single Canadian political subdivision may exceed 0.75% of the book value of the portfolio. Canadian political
subdivisions in aggregate shall not exceed 5% of the portfolio. Securities issued and/or guaranteed by a state
or its political subdivision must be rated A3/A- or better by a nationally recognized rating service. Securities
issued  by  a  qualifying  corporation  and  purchased  prior  to  May  9,  2008,  must  be  rated  A3/A-  or  better  by  a
nationally recognized rating service.

Table  13  presents  the  credit  risk  of  the  fixed-income  or  variable-income  securities  of  the  major  discretely
presented component units.

3. Concentration of Credit Risk

Investment  guidelines  addressing  concentration  of  credit  risk  related  to  the  investment-grade  fixed-income
portion  of  the  University  of  California’s  portfolio  include  a  limit  of  no  more  than  3%  of  the  portfolio’s  market
value to be invested in any single issuer (except for securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies).
These same guidelines apply to the university’s short-term investment pool. The University of California did not
have  investments  in  a  single  issuer  that  represented  5%  or  more  of  total  fair  value  of  all  investments  as  of
June  30,  2010.  Each  campus  foundation  may  have  its  own  individual  investment  policy  designed  to  limit
exposure to a concentration of credit risk.

4. Custodial Credit Risk

The  University  of  California’s  securities  are  registered  in  the  university’s  name  by  the  custodial  bank  as  an
agent for the university. Other types of investments represent ownership interests that do not exist in physical
or book-entry form. As a result, custodial credit risk is remote. Some of the investments of certain University of
California campus foundations are exposed to custodial credit risk. These investments may be uninsured or
not registered in the name of the campus foundation and held by a custodian.

Table  14  presents  the  investments  of  the  major  discretely  presented  component  units  subject  to  custodial
credit risk.

5. Foreign Currency Risk

The  University  of  California’s  portfolio  guidelines  for  U.S.  investment-grade  fixed-income  securities  allow
exposure  to  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  bonds  up  to  10%  of  the  total  portfolio  market  value.  Exposure  to
foreign  currency  risk  from  these  securities  may  be  fully  or  partially  hedged  using  forward  foreign  currency
exchange  contracts.  Under  the  university’s  investment  policies,  such  instruments  are  not  permitted  for
speculative use or to create leverage.

Table 15 identifies the investments of the University of California – including its campus foundations – that are
subject to foreign currency risk.

NOTE 6:  NET INVESTMENT IN DIRECT FINANCING LEASES

The State Public Works Board, an agency that accounts for its activities as an enterprise fund, has entered
into lease-purchase agreements with various other primary government agencies, the University of California,
and  certain  local  agencies.  Payments  from  these  leases  will  be  used  to  satisfy  the  principal  and  interest
requirements of revenue bonds issued by the State Public Works Board.

The California State University (CSU), an agency that accounts for its lease activities in the State University
Dormitory Building Maintenance and Equipment Fund, a nonmajor enterprise fund, has entered into 30-year
capital  lease  agreements  with  certain  of  its  auxiliary  organizations  that  are  accounted  for  as  a  nonmajor
discretely presented component unit. These agreements lease existing and newly constructed facilities to the
auxiliary  organizations.  A  portion  of  the  proceeds  from  certain  revenue  bonds  issued  by  CSU  were  used  to
finance the construction of these facilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements

NOTE 9:  SHORT-TERM FINANCING

As part of its cash management program, the State regularly issues short-term obligations to meet cash flow
needs.  The  State  issues  revenue  anticipation  notes  (RANs)  to  partially  fund  timing  differences  between
revenues and expenditures. A significant portion of the General Fund revenues are received in the latter half of
the fiscal year, while disbursements are paid more evenly throughout the fiscal year. If additional external cash
flow borrowing is required, the State issues revenue anticipation warrants (RAWs). 

To fund cash flow needs for the 2009-10 fiscal year, in July 2009 the State began issuing registered warrants
(IOUs) in lieu of warrants (checks) for certain obligations not having payment priority under law. The State then
issued  $1.5  billion  of  interim  RANs  through  private  placement  on  August  27,  2009.  The  proceeds  from  the
interim  RANs  were  used  to  redeem  the  $2.6  billion  in  outstanding  registered  warrants  that  were  subject  to
redemption on September 4, 2009.  The interim RANs were repaid on September 29, 2009. In addition, the
State issued $8.8 billion of RANs on September 29, 2009. The RANs were repaid during May and June 2010.

The  California  Housing  Finance  Agency,  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  entered  into  an  agreement
with a financial institution to provide a line of credit for short-term borrowings of up to $100 million, which may
increase up to $150 million. At June 30, 2010, draws totaling $89 million were outstanding.

NOTE 10:  LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

As of June 30, 2010, the primary government had long-term obligations totaling $155.5 billion. Of that amount,
$6.1 billion is due within one year. The largest change in governmental activities long-term obligations is an
increase of $9.1 billion in general obligation bonds payable, as bond sales during the year were much greater
than redemptions. General obligation bonds were issued for public education facilities, transportation projects,
housing  and  emergency  shelters,  and  various  water  and  flood  control  projects.  Other  notable  increases
occurred in net other postemployment benefits obligation, mandated costs, and loans payable.

As of June 30, 2010, the pollution remediation obligations increased to $701 million. Under federal Superfund
law,  responsibility  for  pollution  remediation  is  placed  upon  current  and  previous  owners  or  operators  of
polluted  sites.  Currently,  the  State’s  most  significant  superfund  site  is  the  Stringfellow  Class  1  Hazardous
Waste Disposal Facility (Stringfellow) located in Riverside County. As of June 30, 2010, the State estimates
that  remediation  costs  at  Stringfellow  will  total  $370  million.  At  two  other  sites,  Leviathan  Mine  and  BKK
Landfill,  obligating  events  have  occurred  that  will  probably  result  in  significant  liability  to  the  State,  but
reasonable estimates of the remediation costs cannot be made at this time. Currently, litigation is in process to
determine the responsible party for Leviathan Mine, a superfund site. The State’s activities at the site relate to
water pollution remediation. BKK is a closed Class 1 landfill site at which the State is conducting post-closure
care. In addition to superfund sites, the State’s other pollution remediation efforts include underground storage
tank removal and cleanup, cleanup of polluted groundwater, and contaminated soil removal and cleanup.

The State Mandates liability represents an obligation to reimburse local entities for the cost of new programs,
or  increased  levels  of  service,  mandated  by  the  State.  The  notable  increase  in  the  current  year’s  liability
derives  largely  from  a  state-mandated  program  called  Graduation  Requirements.  A  second  program,
Behavioral Intervention, is also expected to pose a significant liability to the State. However, the expected cost
of  this  program  could  not  be  reasonably  estimated  at  this  time  and  is  therefore  not  included  in  Note  10.  In
2008, there was a tentative settlement in which the State agreed to pay school districts and local education
offices  $520  million  for  past  costs  and  $65  million  a  year  for  future  costs  of  the  Behavioral  Intervention
program.  The  settlement  fell  apart  when  the  Legislature  did  not  provide  the  necessary  funding  for  the

105

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

agreement. At this time, the State expects local entities to submit claims for reimbursement through the regular
mandate payment process.

The other long-term obligations for governmental activities consist of $2.7 billion for net pension obligations,
$214  million  owed  for  lawsuits,  the  University  of  California  unfunded  pension  liability  of  $51 million,  and  the
California Technology Agency notes payable of $35 million. The compensated absences will be liquidated by
the  General  Fund,  special  revenue  funds,  capital  projects  funds,  and  internal  service  funds.  Workers’
compensation and capital leases will be liquidated by the General Fund, special revenue funds, and internal
service funds. The General Fund will liquidate net pension obligations, the Proposition 98 funding guarantee,
lawsuits,  reimbursement  of  costs  incurred  by  local  agencies  and  school  districts  for  costs  mandated  by  the
State, and the University of California pension liability.

The largest change in business-type long-term obligations is an increase of $5.3 billion for loans payable to the
U.S. Department of Labor to cover shortfalls in the Unemployment Programs Fund. The $652 million in other
long-term obligations for business-type activities is mainly for advance collections.

NOTE 12:  COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

The  primary  government  has  two  commercial-paper-borrowing  programs:  a  general  obligation  commercial
paper  program  and  an  enterprise  fund  commercial  paper  program  for  the  Department  of  Water  Resources.
Under the general obligation and enterprise fund programs, commercial paper may be issued at the prevailing
market rate, not to exceed 11%, for periods not to exceed 270 days from the date of issuance. The proceeds
from the initial issuance of commercial paper are restricted primarily for construction costs of general obligation
bond program projects and certain state water projects. For both commercial-paper-borrowing programs, the
commercial  paper  is  retired  by  the  issuance  of  long-term  debt,  so  commercial  paper  is  considered  a
noncurrent liability.

To provide liquidity for the programs, the State has entered into revolving credit agreements with commercial
banks. The current “Letter of Credit” agreement for the general obligation commercial paper program, effective
July 15, 2009, authorizes the issuance of notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion.
The current agreement for the enterprise fund commercial paper program authorizes the issuance of notes in
an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  to  exceed  $142  million.  As  of  June 30,  2010,  the  enterprise  fund
commercial paper program had $46 million in outstanding notes.

During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010,  the  primary  government  issued  $234  million  in  general  obligation
commercial  paper,  $100  million  in  general  obligation  refunding  commercial  paper,  and  $393  million  in
long-term general obligation bonds to retire some of the commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2009. As of
June 30, 2010, the general obligation commercial paper program had $1.3 billion in outstanding commercial
paper notes for governmental activities.

The primary government has a revenue bond anticipation note (BAN) program that consists of borrowing for
capital  improvements  on  certain  California  State  University  campuses.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  $18  million  in
outstanding BANs existed in anticipation of the primary government’s issuing revenue bonds to the public.

108

Notes to the Financial Statements

The University of California, a discretely presented component unit, has established a $2.0 billion commercial
paper program with tax-exempt and taxable components. The program is supported by available investments
in  the  University  of  California’s  investment  pools.  Commercial  paper  has  been  issued  by  the  university  to
provide for interim financing of the construction, renovation, and acquisition of certain facilities and equipment.
Commercial  paper  is  secured  by  a  pledge  of  the  net  revenues  derived  from  the  university’s  ownership  or
operation  of  the  projects  financed—not  by  any  encumbrance,  mortgage,  or  other  pledge  of  property—and
does  not  constitute  a  general  obligation  of  the  University  of  California.  At  June  30,  2010,  outstanding
tax-exempt  and  taxable  commercial  paper  totaled  $71  million  and  $337  million,  respectively.  The  university
has  other  borrowings  consisting  of  contractual  obligations  resulting  from  the  acquisition  of  land  or  buildings
and the construction and renovation of certain facilities. Included in other borrowings, which total $252 million
as of June 30, 2010, are various unsecured financing agreements with commercial banks totaling $105 million.

NOTE 13:  LEASES

The aggregate amount of lease commitments for facilities and equipment of the primary government in effect
as  of  June 30,  2010,  was  approximately  $9.1  billion.  Primary  government  leases  that  are  classified  as
operating  leases,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  standards,  contain  clauses  providing  for  termination.
Operating lease expenditures are recognized as being incurred over the lease term. It is expected that, in the
normal course of business, most of these operating leases will be replaced by similar leases. 

The total present value of minimum capital lease payments for the primary government comprises $6 million
from internal service funds and $5.0 billion from other governmental activities. Note 10, Long-term Obligations,
reports the additions and deductions of capital lease obligations. Also reported in Note 10 are the current and
noncurrent  portions  of  the  capital  lease  obligations.  Lease  expenditures  for  the  year  ended  June 30, 2010,
amounted to approximately $904 million.

Included in the capital lease commitments are lease-purchase agreements amounting to a present value of net
minimum  lease  payments  of  $4.8 billion,  that  certain  state  agencies  have  entered  into  with  the  State  Public
Works Board, an enterprise fund agency. This amount represents 96.3% of the total present value of minimum
capital lease payments of the primary government. Also included in the capital lease commitments are some
lease-purchase agreements to acquire equipment. 

The  capital  lease  commitments  do  not  include  $427  million  in  lease-purchase  agreements  with  building
authorities  that  are  blended  component  units.  These  building  authorities  acquire  or  develop  office  buildings
and  then  lease  the  facilities  to  state  agencies.  Upon  expiration  of  the  lease,  title  passes  to  the  primary
government.  The  costs  of  the  buildings  and  the  related  outstanding  revenue  bonds  and  certificates  of
participation are reported in the government-wide financial statements. Accordingly, the lease receivables or
capital lease obligations associated with these buildings are not included in the financial statements. Table 25
summarizes future minimum lease commitments of the primary government.

NOTE 14:  COMMITMENTS

As of June 30, 2010, the primary government had commitments of $8.2 billion for certain highway construction
projects.  These  commitments  are  not  included  as  a  reserve  for  encumbrances  in  the  Federal  Fund  or  the
Transportation  Fund  because  the  future  expenditures  related  to  these  commitments  will  be  reimbursed  with
$2.5  billion  from  local  governments  and  $5.7 billion  from  proceeds  of  approved  federal  grants.  The  ultimate
liability will not accrue to the State. In addition, the primary government had commitments of $732 million for
various  education  programs,  $491 million  for  terrorism  and  disaster  prevention  preparedness  and  response
projects, $370 million for community service programs, $151 million for services provided under various public
health  programs,  $74 million  for  services  provided  under  the  welfare  program,  and  $14 million  for  services
provided under the child support program that are not included as a reserve for encumbrances in the Federal
Fund and will be reimbursed by the proceeds of approved federal grants.

The primary government had other commitments, totaling $12.3 billion, that are not included as a liability on
the  Balance  Sheet  or  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets.  The  $12.3  billion  in  commitments  include  grant
agreements totaling approximately $5.8 billion to reimburse other entities for construction projects for school
building  aid,  parks,  transportation-related  infrastructure,  housing,  and  other  improvements,  and  to  reimburse
counties and cities for costs associated with various programs. Any constructed assets will not belong to the
primary  government,  whose  payments  are  contingent  upon  the  other  entities  entering  into  construction
contracts.  The  $12.3  billion  in  commitments  includes  $3.8  billion  in  long-term  contracts  to  purchase  power;
most of these contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception under GASB 53 and
therefore not included on the Statement of Net Assets of the Electric Power Fund nor disclosed in Note 17. In
addition, the $12.3 billion in commitments includes $790 million in undisbursed loan commitments for various
programs aimed at providing housing and emergency shelter to needy persons.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

for  California  State  University  construction  projects.  The  University  participates 

The $12.3 billion in commitments also includes contracts of $691 million for the construction of water projects
and  the  purchase  of  power  that  are  not  included  as  a  liability  on  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  of  the  Water
Resources Fund. Included in this amount are certain power purchase, sale, and exchange contracts. These
contracts had a fair value of $159 million as of June 30, 2010. The Department of Water Resources entered
into  bilateral  arrangements  with  a  fair  value  of  $16  million  to  hedge  the  price  of  natural  gas,  and  has
terminated  and  settled  all  contracts  as  of  June  30,  2010.  The  primary  government  had  commitments  of
$359 million 
in
forward-purchase  contracts  of  natural  gas  and  electricity.    As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  University’s  obligation
under  these  special  purchase  arrangements  requires  it  to  purchase  at  fixed  prices  an  estimated  total  of
$42 million of electricity through March 2014 and $66 million of natural gas through June 2017. The primary
government also had commitments of $8 million to veterans for the purchase of properties under contracts of
sale. The California State Lottery Commission had commitments of $782 million, of which $731 million is for
gaming and telecommunication systems and services and $51 million is for a construction contract. These are
long-term projects, and all of the contracts’ needs may not have been defined. The projects will be funded with
existing  and  future  program  resources  or  with  the  proceeds  of  revenue  and  general  obligation  bonds.

As of June 30, 2010, the discretely presented component units had other commitments that are not included
as liabilities on the Statement of Net Assets. The University of California had authorized construction projects
totaling  $2.7 billion.  The  university  also  made  commitments  to  make  investments  in  certain  investment
partnerships pursuant to provisions in the partnership agreements. These commitments totaled $316 million as
of June 30, 2010. The California Housing Finance Agency had outstanding commitments to provide $1 million
for  loans  under  its  housing  programs.  The  California  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  had  capital
commitments  to  private  equity  funds  of  $20.1  billion  and  commitments  to  purchase  real  estate  equity  of
$7.4 billion that remained unfunded and not recorded as liabilities on the Statement of Net Assets of either the
fiduciary or discretely presented component units.

NOTE 15:  GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS

The State Constitution permits the primary government to issue general obligation bonds for specific purposes
and in such amounts as approved by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the Legislature and by a majority
of voters in a general or direct primary election. The debt service for general obligation bonds is appropriated
from  the  General  Fund.  Under  the  State  Constitution,  the  General  Fund  is  used  first  to  support  the  public
school system and public institutions of higher education; the General Fund can then be used to service the
debt on outstanding general obligation bonds. Enterprise funds and certain other funds reimburse the General
Fund for any debt service it provides on their behalf. General obligation bonds that are directly related to, and
are expected to be paid from, the resources of enterprise funds are included as a liability of such funds in the
financial statements. However, the General Fund may be liable for the payment of any principal and interest
on these bonds that is not met from the resources of such funds.

As  of  June 30, 2010,  the  State  had  $76.7  billion  in  outstanding  general  obligation  bonds  related  to
governmental activities and $1.5 billion related to business-type activities. In addition, $42.9 billion of general
obligation  bonds  had  been  authorized  but  not  issued.  This  amount  includes  $13.7  billion  authorized  by  the
applicable finance committees for issuance in the form of commercial paper notes. Of this amount, $1.3 billion
in general obligation indebtedness was issued in the form of commercial paper notes but was not yet retired by
long-term bonds.

Note 10, Long-term Obligations, discusses the change to general obligation bonds payable.

112

Notes to the Financial Statements

A. Variable-rate General Obligation Bonds

The  State  issues  both  fixed  and  variable-rate  general  obligation  bonds.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  State  had
$2.7 billion of variable-rate general obligation bonds outstanding, consisting of $912 million in daily rate and
$1.8 billion in weekly rate. The interest rates associated with the daily rates and weekly rates are determined
by the remarketing agents to be the lowest rate that would allow the bonds to sell on the effective date of such
rate at a price (without regard to accrued interest) equal to 100% of the principal amount. The interest is paid
on the first business day of each calendar month.

Letters of credit were issued to secure payment of principal and interest on the daily and weekly variable-rate
bonds.  Under  these  letters  of  credit,  the  credit  providers  pay  all  principal  and  interest  payments  to  the
bondholders; the State is then required to reimburse the credit providers for the amounts paid. Different credit
providers exist for each series of variable-rate bonds issued. The letters of credit for the variable-rate bonds
issued  during  the  2002-03  fiscal  year  have  expiration  dates  of  December  1,  2010,  December  1,  2011,  and
December  1,  2012. The  letters  of  credit  for  the  variable-rate  bonds  issued  during  the  2004-05  and  2005-06
fiscal years have expiration dates of October 15, 2012, and November 17, 2010, respectively.

Based on the schedules provided in the Official Statements, sinking fund deposits for the variable-rate general
obligation bonds will be set aside in a mandatory sinking fund at the beginning of each of the following fiscal
years: the 2015-16 through 2033-34 fiscal years and the 2039-40 fiscal year. The deposits set aside in any
fiscal year may be applied, with approval of the State Treasurer and the appropriate bond finance committees,
to the redemption of any other general obligation bonds then outstanding. To the extent that the deposit is not
applied by January 31 of each fiscal year, the variable-rate general obligation bonds will be redeemed in whole
or in part on an interest payment date in that fiscal year.

B. Economic Recovery Bonds

In  2004  voters  approved  the  one-time  issuance  of  Economic  Recovery  Bonds.  The  debt  service  for  these
bonds  is  payable  from  and  secured  by  amounts  available  in  the  Economic  Recovery  Bond  Sinking  Fund,  a
debt service fund that consists primarily of revenues from a dedicated sales tax. However, the General Fund
may  be  liable  for  the  payment  of  any  principal  and  interest  on  the  bonds  that  cannot  be  paid  from  the
Economic Recovery Bond Sinking Fund. 

As of June 30, 2010, the State had $7.9 billion of Economic Recovery Bonds outstanding. Of the $7.9 billion
outstanding, bonds totaling $953 million are variable rate bonds, consisting of $500 million in daily rates and
$453 million in weekly rates. The interest rates associated with the daily rates and weekly rates are determined
by the remarketing agents to be the lowest rates that would enable them to sell the bonds for delivery on the
effective  date  of  such  rate  at  a  price  (without  regard  to  accrued  interest)  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal
amount.  The  interest  is  paid  on  the  first  business  day  of  each  calendar  month.  As  described  in  the  Official
Statement,  payment  of  principal,  interest,  and  purchase  price  upon  tender,  for  a  portion  of  these  bonds,  is
secured by a direct-pay letter of credit. Payment of principal and interest for another portion of these bonds is
secured by a bond insurance policy, together with an insured standby bond purchase agreement upon tender.
A  separate,  uninsured  standby  bond-purchase  agreement  supports  the  purchase  upon  tender  for  the  final
portion of these bonds, without credit enhancement in the form of an insurance policy or letter of credit related
to  the  payment  of  principal  or  interest.  The  State  reimburses  its  credit  providers  for  any  amounts  paid,  plus
interest. Different credit providers exist for each series of variable-rate bonds issued. The expiration dates for
these  letters  of  credit,  bond  insurance  policies,  and  standby  bond  purchase  agreements  fall  between
June 15, 2011 and June 15, 2012.

C. Mandatory Tender Bonds

Of  the  $7.9  billion  in  outstanding  Economic  Recovery  Bonds,  $500  million  have  interest-reset  dates  of
July 1, 2014. At that time, the bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount, plus accrued interest, without premium. Upon mandatory tender, the State will seek to
remarket  these  bonds.  The  debt  service  requirements  published  in  the  Official  Statement  differ  from  the
calculation included in Table 27 because the statement presumes a successful remarketing at an interest rate
of 4.0% per year. The debt service calculation in Table 27 uses the interest rates in effect at year-end, which
are the same interest rates in effect until the applicable reset date. In the event of a failed remarketing, the
State is required to return all tendered bonds to their initial purchasers and pay an annual interest rate of 11%
until the bonds are successfully remarketed.

As of June 30, 2010, the State had $1.0 billion in outstanding various-purpose general obligation bonds with
interest reset dates beginning April 2, 2012. On each reset date, these bonds are subject to mandatory tender
for purchase at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, without premium,
unless the bonds have been called for redemption on or prior to that date. If the bonds are not redeemed, the
interest  rate  mode  for  the  bonds  will  be  adjusted  to  a  new  mode,  and  the  bonds  will  be  remarketed  by  a
remarketing agent appointed by the State. The State has not obtained any credit enhancement with respect to
the mandatory tender of these bonds on the first mandatory tender date and does not expect to do so. The
debt service calculation in Table 27 uses the interest rates in effect at year-end, which are the same interest
rates  in  effect  until  the  applicable  reset  dates,  and  assumes  full  redemption  of  the  bonds  beginning  on
April 1, 2029.  In  the  event  of  a  failed  remarketing,  funding  for  the  payment  of  principal  and  interest  will  be
provided by the General Fund.

D. Build America Bonds

As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  State  had  $10.5  billion  in  taxable  various-purpose  general  obligation  bonds
outstanding that were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 signed into law on February 17, 2009 (ARRA). While most of the bonds mature in 2034 and 2039, two
series are part of the mandatory tender bonds previously described that have reset dates of April 2, 2012 and
April  1,  2013.  Pursuant  to  the  ARRA,  the  State  receives  a  cash  subsidy  payment  from  the  United  States
Treasury  equal  to  35%  of  the  interest  payable  by  the  State  on  the  Build  America  Bonds  on  or  near  each
interest payment date. The cash payment does not constitute a full faith and credit guarantee of the United
States  Government,  but  is  required  to  be  paid  by  the  United  States  Treasury  under  the  ARRA.  The  cash
subsidy payments received are available for use by the General Fund.

E. Debt Service Requirements

Table  27  shows  the  debt  service  requirements  for  all  general  obligation  bonds  as  of  June 30, 2010.  The
estimated  debt  service  requirements  for  the  $2.7 billion  variable-rate  general  obligation  bonds  and  the
$953 million variable-rate Economic Recovery Bonds are calculated using the actual interest rates in effect on
June 30, 2010.

F. General Obligation Bond Defeasances

1. Current Year

On October 15, 2009, the primary government issued $211 million in general obligation refunding bonds and
$236 million in taxable general obligation refunding bonds to immediately refund $250 million in outstanding
mandatory  tender  general  obligation  bonds  maturing  in  2029-2038  and  $200  million  in  outstanding
variable-rate general obligation bonds maturing in 2033-2034. As a result, the refunded bonds are defeased
and  the  liability  for  those  bonds  has  been  removed  from  the  financial  statements.  The  purpose  of  this
refunding was to reorganize the debt structure of the State.

On November 5, 2009, the primary government issued $3.4 billion in refunding Economic Recovery Bonds to
current-refund  and  advance-refund  $3.3  billion  in  outstanding  Economic  Recovery  Bonds  maturing  in
2010-2015  and  2023.  The  primary  government  placed  the  net  proceeds  into  an  irrevocable  trust  to  pay  the
debt service on the refunded bonds. As a result, the refunded bonds are considered defeased and the liability
for those bonds has been removed from the financial statements. The refunding increased overall debt service
by $1.3 billion and resulted in an economic loss of $197 million. The economic loss is the difference between
the  present  value  of  the  old  debt  service  requirements  and  the  present  value  of  the  new  debt  service
requirements, discounted at 4.5% per year over the life of the new bonds.

115

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

On November 12, 2009, the primary government issued $194 million in general obligation refunding bonds to
immediately  refund  $194  million  in  outstanding  mandatory  tender  general  obligation  bonds  maturing  in
2030-2039. As a result, the refunded bonds are defeased and the liability for those bonds has been removed
from the financial statements. The purpose of this refunding was to reorganize the debt structure of the State.

On  November  18,  2009,  the  primary  government  issued  $100  million  in  general  obligation  refunding
commercial  paper  to  immediately  refund  $100  million  in  outstanding  variable-rate  general  obligation  bonds
maturing in 2033.

On June 29, 2010, the primary government issued $119 million in veterans general obligation bonds. A portion
of  the  proceeds  was  used  to  current-refund  $94  million  in  outstanding  veterans  general  obligation  bonds
maturing in 2011-2017 and 2019. As a result, the refunded bonds are considered defeased and the liability for
those bonds has been removed from the financial statements. The refunding decreased overall debt service
by $10 million and resulted in an economic gain of $9 million. The economic gain is the difference between the
present  value  of  the  old  debt  service  requirements  and  the  present  value  of  the  new  debt  service
requirements, discounted at 2.7% per year over the life of the new bonds.

2. Prior Years

In  prior  years,  the  primary  government  placed  the  proceeds  of  the  refunding  bonds  in  a  special  irrevocable
escrow  trust  account  with  the  State  Treasury  to  provide  for  all  future  debt  service  payments  on  defeased
bonds.  The  assets  of  the  trust  accounts  and  the  liability  for  defeased  bonds  are  not  included  in  the  State’s
financial  statements.  As  of  June 30,  2010,  the  outstanding  balance  of  general  obligation  bonds  defeased  in
prior years was approximately $5.0 billion.

NOTE 16:  REVENUE BONDS

A. Governmental Activities

The State Treasurer is authorized by state law to issue Federal Highway Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles
(GARVEE  bonds).  The  purpose  of  these  bonds  is  to  accelerate  the  funding  and  construction  of  critical
transportation  infrastructure  projects  in  order  to  provide  congestion  relief  benefits  to  the  public  significantly
sooner  than  with  traditional  funding  mechanisms.  These  bonds  are  secured  and  payable  from  the  annual
federal appropriation for the State’s federal-aid transportation projects. The primary government has no legal
liability for the payment of principal and interest on these revenue bonds. Total principal and interest remaining
on  the  bonds  is  $478  million,  payable  through  2020.  In  addition,  the  California  Alternative  Energy  and
Advanced Transportation Financing Authority is authorized to issue Clean Renewable Energy Bonds to fund
the  acquisition  and  installation  of  certain  transportation  related  solar  energy  facilities  located  throughout  the
state.  Both  of  these  bonds  fund  activity  in  the  Transportation  Fund  and  are  included  in  the  governmental
activities column of the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.

The Golden State Tobacco Securitization Corporation (GSTSC), a blended component unit, is authorized by
state  law  to  issue  asset-backed  bonds  to  purchase  the  State’s  rights  to  future  revenues  from  the  Master
Settlement Agreement with participating tobacco companies. These bonds are secured by and payable solely
from future Tobacco Settlement Revenue and interest earned on that revenue. The primary government has
no legal liability for the payment of principal and interest on these bonds. Total principal and interest remaining
on  the  bonds  is  $20.4  billion,  payable  through  2047.  The  annual  principal  and  interest  payments  on  these
bonds are expected to require all of the Tobacco Settlement Revenue and interest. Principal and interest paid
in the current year and total Tobacco Settlement Revenue and interest were $454 million and $393 million,

116

Notes to the Financial Statements

respectively.  These  bonds  are  included  in  the  governmental  activities  column  of  the  government-wide
Statement of Net Assets.

Under  state  law,  certain  building  authorities  may  issue  revenue  bonds.  These  bonds  are  issued  for  the
purpose of constructing state office buildings. Leases with state agencies pay the principal and interest on the
revenue  bonds  issued  by  the  building  authorities.  The  primary  government  has  no  legal  liability  for  the
payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  these  revenue  bonds.  These  revenue  bonds  are  included  in  the
governmental activities column of the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.

B. Business-type Activities

Revenue  bonds  that  are  directly  related  to,  and  are  expected  to  be  paid  from,  the  resources  of  enterprise
funds are included in the accounts of such funds. Principal and interest on revenue bonds are payable from
the pledged revenues of the respective funds of agencies that issued the bonds. The General Fund has no
legal liability for payment of principal and interest on revenue bonds.

Revenue  bonds  to  acquire,  construct,  or  renovate  state  facilities  or  to  refund  outstanding  revenue  bonds  in
advance  of  maturity  are  issued  for  water  resources,  public  building  construction,  financing  of  electric  power
purchases for resale  to utility customers, and certain nonmajor enterprise funds.

C. Discretely Presented Component Units 

The  University  of  California  issues  revenue  bonds  to  finance  various  auxiliary,  administrative,  academic,
medical  center,  and  research  facilities.  The  revenue  bonds  are  not  collateralized  by  any  encumbrance,
mortgage, or other pledge of property, except pledged revenues, and do not constitute general obligations of
the university.

Under  state  law,  the  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  (CalHFA)  issues  fixed-  and  variable-rate  revenue
bonds  to  fund  loans  to  qualified  borrowers  for  single-family  houses  and  multifamily  developments.
Variable-rate  debt  is  typically  related  to  a  common  index,  such  as  the  Securities  Industry  and  Financial
Markets Association (SIFMA) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and is reset periodically. CalHFA
issues both federally taxable and tax-exempt bonds. The bonds issued by CalHFA are payable solely from and
collateralized by pledged revenues and other assets.

D. Revenue Bond Defeasances

1. Current Year—Governmental Activities

The primary government did not issue any refunding bonds in the 2009-10 fiscal year.

2. Current Year—Business-type Activities

In  December  2009,  the  primary  government  issued  $169  million  in  water  system  revenue  bonds.  The  bond
proceeds were used to current-refund $168 million of outstanding water system revenue bonds. The proceeds
were deposited into an escrow account to provide for all future debt service payments on the refunded bonds.
As a result, the bonds are considered defeased and the liability for those bonds has been removed from the
financial  statements.  This  refunding  will  decrease  debt  service  payments  by  $14  million  over  the  life  of  the
bonds and will result in an economic gain of $8 million for the refunded bonds. These water system revenue
bonds are reported in the Water Resources Fund.

In  May  2010,  the  primary  goverment  issued  $3.0  billion  in  fixed-rate  power  supply  revenue  bonds  to
current-refund $2.7 billion of outstanding variable-rate bonds and advance-refund $430 million of outstanding
fixed-rate  bonds.  The  refunding  reduced  the  amount  of  outstanding  variable-rate  debt  and  reduced  the  risk

119

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

and  dependency  from  credit  support  providers  and  interest-rate  swap  counterparties.  The  proceeds  were
deposited into an escrow account to provide for all future debt service payments on the refunded bonds. As a
result,  the  bonds  are  considered  defeased  and  the  liability  for  these  bonds  has  been  removed  from  the
financial statements. The refunding decreased overall debt service payments by $38 million and resulted in an
economic gain of $14 million. The power supply revenue bonds are reported in the Electric Power Fund.

3. Current Year—Discretely Presented Component Units

The discretely presented component units did not issue any refunding bonds in the  2009-10 fiscal year.

4. Prior Years

In  prior  years,  the  primary  government  defeased  certain  bonds  by  placing  the  proceeds  of  new  bonds  in
irrevocable  trust  accounts  to  provide  for  all  future  debt  service  requirements.  Accordingly,  the  assets  and
liabilities  for  these  defeased  bonds  are  not  included  in  the  financial  statements.  As  of  June 30,  2010,  the
outstanding balance of revenue bonds defeased in prior years was $4.3 billion for governmental activities and
$2.5 billion for business-type activities.

In  prior  years,  the  University  of  California,  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  defeased  certain  bonds.
Investments that have maturities and interest rates sufficient to fund retirement of defeased liabilities are being
held in irrevocable trusts for the debt service payments. Accordingly, the assets of the trust accounts and the
liabilities for the defeased bonds are not included in the State’s financial statements. As of June 30, 2010, the
outstanding balance of University of California revenue bonds defeased in prior years was $744 million.

NOTE 17:  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Certain  primary  government  business-type  activities  and  discretely  presented  component  units  use
derivatives—including futures, forward contracts, options and interest rate swap contracts—as a substitute for
investment  in  equity  and  fixed-income  securities,  to  reduce  the  effect  of  fluctuating  foreign  currencies  on
foreign currency-denominated investments, or to limit its exposure of variable-rate bonds to changes in market
interest rates.

A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security, financial index, interest rate,
foreign currency, or other financial instrument at a set price on a future date. They are standardized contracts
that can be easily bought and sold and are exchange-traded. A futures contract obligates a buyer to purchase
the  commodity  or  financial  instrument  and  a  seller  to  sell  it,  unless  an  offsetting  contract  is  entered  into  to
offset one’s obligation. The resources or obligations acquired through these contracts are usually terminated
by entering into offsetting contracts.

Forward contracts are similar to futures contracts, although they are not exchange-traded. One example of a
forward  contract  is  a  foreign  currency  exchange  contract  used  to  hedge  against  foreign  currency  exchange
rate  risks  on  non-U.S.  dollar-denominated  investment  securities  and  to  increase  or  decrease  exposure  to
various  foreign  currencies.  Another  example  is  when  forward  contracts  are  used  to  purchase  certain
mortgage-backed securities on a to-be-announced (TBA) basis when the price cannot be determined until the
coupon rate is known. A forward contract on a TBA basis is a commitment to purchase a mortgage-backed
pass-through  pooled  security  when  issued  by  the  Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  (Fannie  Mae),
Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  (Freddie  Mac),  and  Government  National  Mortgage  Association
(Ginnie Mae).

Notes to the Financial Statements

An  option  contract  gives  the  State  the  right,  but  not  the  obligation,  to  buy  or  sell  a  financial  instrument  or
commodity at a fixed price during a specified period. 

The  State  considers  its  futures,  forward  contracts,  and  options  to  be  investment  derivatives.  A  swap  is  a
contractual  agreement  to  exhange  future  cash  flows.  These  cash  flows  may  be  either  fixed  or  variable  and
may  be  either  received  or  paid.  The  State  holds  interest  rate  swaps  as  both  investment  derivatives  and
hedging derivatives.

Table 30 shows debt service requirements as of June 30, 2010, for variable-rate debt included in Table 29, as
well as net swap payments, assuming that current interest rates remain the same for their terms. As interest
rates vary, variable-rate bond interest payments and net swap payments will vary.

1. Natural Gas Swaps and Options

Objective: The DWR enters into forward gas futures and options contracts to hedge the cost of natural gas.
Most of the DWR’s forward gas futures are being treated as normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) contracts
and are therefore not required to be recorded prior to settlement. Forward gas futures not qualifying as NPNS
are recorded on the statement of net assets at fair value. All natural gas options are treated as derivatives and
are  classified  as  investment  derivatives.  For  the  DWR’s  gas  hedging  contracts  that  are  effective  hedges,
unrealized gains and losses are deferred on the statement of net assets as other current assets or liabilities for
contracts with fewer than 12 months remaining until expiration, or as other noncurrent assets or liabilities for
contracts  with  more  than  12  months  remaining  until  expiration.  The  deferred  amount  recorded  on  the
statement  of  net  assets  reflects  the  deferred  inflow  or  outflow  associated  with  the  derivative  financial

122

Notes to the Financial Statements

instruments. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are classified as investment derivatives are included as
investment and interest income on the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in fund net assets.

Fair Value: The reported fair values from Table 31 above were determined based on quoted market prices for
similar financial instruments.

Credit  Risk:  The  DWR’s  open  natural  gas  hedge  positions  at  June  30,  2010  are  with  ten  different
counterparties, all of which have credit ratings of at least A-/Baa1. At June 30, 2010, the DWR has credit risk
exposure to three counterparties totaling $3 million, representing transactions with market values that are in
the DWR’s favor. There is no substantial credit exposure to the remaining seven counterparties, as the sharp
decrease in natural gas prices has resulted in valuations in the counterparties’ favor. The remaining gas hedge
positions  have  been  entered  into  through  the  DWR’s  brokerage  accounts  and  the  associated  clearing
accounts have collateral requirements that limit the DWR’s counterparty credit risk.

Termination  Risk:  With  regards  to  gas  hedge  agreements,  the  DWR  or  the  counterparty  may  terminate  an
agreement if the other party fails to perform under the terms of the contract. In addition, the agreements allow
either party to terminate in the event of a significant loss of creditworthiness by the other party. If a termination
were to occur, the DWR or the counterparty would owe the other a payment equal to the fair value of the open
positions.

2. Interest-Rate Swaps

Objective:  The  DWR  entered  into  interest-rate  swap  agreements  with  various  counterparties  to  reduce
variable-interest-rate  risk  for  the  Electric  Power  Fund.  The  swaps  create  a  synthetic  fixed  rate.  The  DWR
agreed to make fixed-rate payments and receive floating-rate payments on notional amounts equal to a portion
of the principal amount of this variable-rate debt. As of June 30, 2010, all of the DWR’s interest rate swaps are
considered effective hedging derivatives and have been recorded at fair value on the statement of net assets
as other noncurrent assets or liabilities.

Terms and Fair Value: Table 32 summarizes the terms and fair value of the swap agreements entered into by
DWR. Total principal, variable interest, and interest-rate swap debt service requirements as of June 30, 2010,
are  $1.1 billion,  $15  million,  and  $143  million,  respectively.  The  notional  amounts  of  the  swaps  match  the
principal amounts of the associated debt. The swap agreements contain scheduled reductions to outstanding
notional amounts that follow scheduled amortization of the associated debt. As of June 30, 2010, the variable
rates  on  the  DWR’s  hedged  bonds  ranged  from  0.02%  to  2.5%,  while  the  variable  rates  received  on  the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based swaps were 0.15% to 0.24% and the variable rate received on
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)-based swaps was 0.15% to 0.43%. The fair
values were determined based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.

Credit Risk: The DWR has a total of six swap agreements with six different counterparties. Credit ratings of the
counterparties range from BBB to AA- except for one counterparty that is not rated. Table 32 summarizes the
credit ratings of the counterparties for the swap agreements.

Basis Risk: The DWR is exposed to basis risk on the swaps whose payments are calculated on the basis of a
percentage of LIBOR. The basis risk results from the fact that the DWR’s floating interest payments payable
on the underlying debt are determined in the tax-exempt market, while the DWR floating receipts on the swaps
are based on LIBOR, which is determined in the taxable market. Should the relationship between LIBOR and
the tax-exempt market change and move to convergence, or should the DWR’s bonds trade at levels higher in
rate in relation to the tax-exempt market, the DWR’s cost would increase.

Termination Risk: The DWR’s swap agreements do not contain any out-of-the-ordinary termination provisions
that  would  expose  it  to  significant  termination  risk.  In  keeping  with  market  standards,  the  DWR  or  the
counterparty  may  terminate  a  swap  agreement  if  the  other  party  fails  to  perform  under  the  terms  of  the
contract or significantly loses creditworthiness. If a termination were to occur, the DWR would, at the time of
the termination, be liable for payment equal to the swap’s fair value, if it had a negative fair value at that time.
The counterparty would be liable for any payment equal to the swap’s fair value, if it had positive fair value at
the time.

Rollover Risk: Other than termination, limited rollover risk is associated with the swap agreements because the
agreements  have  termination  dates  and  notional  amounts  that  are  tied  to  equivalent  maturity  dates  and
principal amounts of amortizing debt.

Termination  of  Interest  Rate  Swaps:  During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2010,  the  DWR  elected  to  terminate
$1.0 billion notional of five-year constant maturity basis interest rate swaps, receiving $42 million in termination
payments.  The  basis  swaps  were  deemed  ineffective  and  were  accounted  for  as  investment  hedges.  The
termination  resulted  in  the  DWR  realizing  investment  income  of  $1  million  for  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,
representing the net increase in fair value of these swaps during fiscal year 2010 prior to their termination. As
part  of  the  May  2010  refunding  transaction,  the  DWR  terminated  $2.7  billion  notional  of  LIBOR-based
interest-rate swaps. The DWR incurred $188 million in swap termination costs, which will be amortized over
the life of the refunding bonds.

Notes to the Financial Statements

B. Fiduciary Funds

Under  the  State  Constitution  and  statutory  provisions  governing  the  investment  authority  of  the  California
Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  (CalPERS),  CalPERS  holds  investments  in  swaps,  options,  futures,
rights, and warrants and enters into forward foreign currency exchange and TBA security contracts. The fair
value of options, futures, rights, and warrants is determined based upon quoted market prices. The fair value
of  derivative  investments  that  are  not  exchange  traded,  such  as  swaps  and  TBAs,  is  determined  by  an
external pricing service using various proprietary methods. Futures contracts are marked-to-market at the end
of each trading day and the settlement of gains or losses occur on the following business day through variation
margins. The fair value of international currency forwards represents the unrealized gain or loss on the related
contracts,  which  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  specified  contract  exchange  rate  and  the
exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. 

CalPERS uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge against changes in exchange
rates related to foreign securities. Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as either investments or
receivables (net) in the statement of fiduciary net assets. Derivatives with negative fair values are recorded as
other liabilities in the statement of fiduciary net assets. Changes in fair value are recorded as net appreciation
or depreciation in fair value of investments in the statement of changes in fiduciary net assets.

The  California  State  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (CalSTRS)  also  holds  investments  in  derivative
instruments. CalSTRS’ investments that are not exchange traded, such as swaps and TBAs, are valued using
methods employed for debt securities. Futures contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each trading day
and  the  settlement  of  gains  or  losses  occur  on  the  following  business  day.  As  a  result,  the  derivative
instruments themselves have no fair value at June 30, 2010, or at the end of any trading day. Daily settlement
of gains and losses is a risk control measure to limit counterparty credit risk. Futures variation margin amounts
are settled each trading day and are recognized as net appreciation or depreciation in fair value of investments
as they are incurred in the statement of changes in fiduciary net assets.

CalSTRS  holds  foreign  currency  forwards,  which  are  obligations  to  buy  or  sell  a  currency  at  a  specified
exchange  rate  and  quantity  on  a  specific  future  date.  The  fair  value  of  foreign  currency  forwards  is  the
unrealized  gain  or  loss  calculated  based  on  the  difference  between  the  specified  exchange  rate  and  the
closing exchange rate at June 30, 2010. Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as investments in
the statement of fiduciary net assets. Derivatives with negative fair values are recorded as accounts payable in
the statement of fiduciary net assets. Changes in fair value are recorded as net appreciation or depreciation in
fair value of investments in the statement of changes in fiduciary net assets.

Notes to the Financial Statements

Credit Risk: Due to the level of risk associated with certain derivative investment securities, it is reasonably
possible  that  changes  in  the  values  of  investment  securities  will  occur  in  the  near  term,  and  such  changes
could  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  financial  statements.  CalPERS  could  be  exposed  to  risk  if  the
counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the terms of the contracts. CalPERS seeks to control this
risk through counterparty credit evaluations and approvals, counterparty credit limits, and exposure monitoring
procedures.  CalPERS  anticipates  that  the  counterparties  will  be  able  to  satisfy  their  obligations  under  the
contracts.

Table  36  details  the  counterparty,  percent  of  net  exposure,  and  credit  ratings  for  the  derivative  instruments
held by CalPERS that were subject to credit risk.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

In cases where a wholly owned broker-dealer does not engage the rating companies for a standalone rating,
the subsidiary is assigned the parent company rating as the broker-dealer is an integral part of their business
model(s).  With  the  exception  of  forward-trade  commitments  (TBAs  and  foreign  currency  forwards),  it  is
CalSTRS’ practice to require counterparty collateral posting provisions in its non-exchange-traded derivative
instruments  where  it  is  consistent  with  market  practice.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  CalSTRS  does  not  hold  any
collateral  related  to  its  non-exchange-traded  derivative  instruments.  The  aggregate  fair  value  of  investment
derivative  instruments  in  an  asset  position  subject  to  counterparty  credit  risk  at  June  30,  2010,  was
$13.8 million.  This  represents  the  maximum  loss  that  would  be  recognized  at  the  reporting  date  if  all
counterparties  failed  to  perform  as  contracted.  At  June  30,  2010,  CalSTRS  did  not  have  any  significant
exposure to counterparty credit risk with any single party. 

While CalSTRS did not have any master netting agreements with its counterparties at June 30, 2010, Table 37
presents  exposure  for  similar  instruments  with  the  same  counterparty  on  a  net  basis  and  describes  the
counterparty  credit  ratings  for  the  non-exchange-traded  derivative  instruments  held  by  CalSTRS  that  were
outstanding and subject to loss.

C. Discretely Presented Component Unit—University of California

The University of California, a discretely presented component unit, holds investment derivatives in futures and
forward  contracts,  and  interest-rate  swap  contracts.  The  university  also  uses  forward  contracts  to  purchase
securities on a TBA basis. The Board of Trustees for each campus foundation may also authorize derivatives
in its investment policy. The university enters into futures contracts for the purpose of acting as a substitute for
investment  in  equity  and  fixed-income  securities.  The  university  also  holds  interest-rate  swaps  that  are
derivative  instruments  that  meet  the  criteria  for  an  effective  hedge.  Certain  of  the  interest-rate  swaps  are
considered  hybrid  instruments  since,  at  the  time  of  execution,  the  fixed  rate  on  each  of  the  swaps  was
off-market  and  the  university  received  an  up-front  payment.  As  such,  these  swaps  are  comprised  of  a
derivative  instrument,  an  at-the-market  swap  that  is  an  effective  hedge,  and  a  companion  instrument,  a
borrowing  represented  by  the  up-front  payment.  The  unamortized  amount  of  the  borrowing  under  the

130

Notes to the Financial Statements

companion instrument was $31 million at June 30, 2010. Derivatives are recorded at fair value as either assets
or liabilities in the statement of net assets. Certain derivatives are determined to be hedging derivatives and
designated  as  either  a  fair  value  or  cash-flow  hedge.  Under  hedge  accounting,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of
hedging derivatives are considered to be deferred inflows (for hedging derivatives with positive fair values) or
deferred outflows (for hedging derivatives with negative fair values). Deferred inflows are included with other
noncurrent  liabilities  and  deferred  outflows  with  other  noncurrent  assets  in  the  statement  of  net  assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not hedging derivatives are reported as net appreciation or
depreciation  in  fair  value  of  investments  in  the  statement  of  activities.  Table  38  summarizes  the  fair  value
balances and notional amounts of derivative instruments outstanding, categorized by type, and the changes in
fair value of such derivatives.

Table  30  includes  the  university’s  debt  service  requirements  and  net  swap  payments  as  of  June 30, 2010.
Total  principal,  variable  interest,  and  interest  rate  net  swap  payments  are  $278 million,  $57 million,  and
$232 million, respectively.

Objective  and  Terms:  The  university  entered  into  interest-rate  swap  agreements  in  connection  with  certain
variable-rate Medical Center Pooled Revenue Bonds as a means to lower borrowing costs, rather than using
fixed-rate  bonds  at  the  time  of  issuance.  Under  each  swap  agreement,  the  university  pays  the  swap
counterparties  a  fixed-interest-rate  payment  and  receives  a  variable-interest-rate  payment  that  effectively
changes the variable-interest-rate bonds to synthetic fixed-rate bonds.

Fair Value: There is a risk that the fair value of a swap will become negative as a result of market conditions.
The  swaps  have  an  estimated  negative  fair  value  of  $64 million  as  of  June 30, 2010.  The  fair  value  of  the
interest  rate  swaps  is  the  estimated  amount  the  university  would  have  either  received  or  paid  if  the  swap
agreements had been terminated on June 30, 2010. The fair value was estimated by  financial institutions or

131

independent  advisors  using  available  quoted  market  prices  or  discounted  expected  future  net  cash  flows.

Interest Rate Risk: There is a risk the value of the interest-rate swaps will decline because of changing interest
rates.  The  values  of  the  interest-rate  swaps  with  longer  maturities  tend  to  be  more  sensitive  to  changing
interest rates and, therefore, more volatile than those with shorter maturities.

Basis Risk: The university is exposed to basis risk whenever the interest rates on the bonds are reset. The
interest  rate  on  the  bonds  is  a  tax-exempt  interest  rate,  while  the  variable  receipt  rate  on  the  interest  rate
swaps  is  taxable.  However,  there  is  no  basis  or  tax  risk  related  to  the  swap  with  the  $190  million  notional
amount  since  the  variable  rate  the  university  pays  to  the  bond  holders  matches  the  variable-rate  payments
received from the swap counterparty and the interest rates are reset at the same intervals.

Termination Risk: The university is exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties resulting
in  cancellation  of  the  synthetic  interest  rate  and  returning  the  interest-rate  payments  to  the  variable  interest
rates  on  the  bonds.  In  addition,  depending  on  the  agreement,  certain  swaps  may  be  terminated  if  the
counterparty’s credit quality rating, as issued by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, falls below certain thresholds.
At termination, the university may also owe a termination payment if there is a realized loss based on the fair
value of the swap.

Credit  Risk:  The  university  could  be  exposed  to  credit  risk  if  the  interest-rate  swap  counterparties  to  the
contracts  are  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  the  contracts.  Contracts  with  positive  fair  values  are  exposed  to
credit  risk.  The  university  faces  a  maximum  possible  loss  equivalent  to  the  amount  of  the  derivative’s  fair
value,  less  any  collateral  held  by  the  university  provided  by  the  counterparty.  Contracts  with  negative  fair
values  are  not  exposed  to  credit  risk.  There  are  no  collateral  requirements  related  to  the  interest-rate  swap
with  the  $89  million  notional  amount.  Depending  on  the  fair  value  related  to  the  swap  with  the  $190  million
notional  amount,  the  university  may  be  entitled  to  receive  collateral  from  the  counterparty  to  the  extent  the
positive fair value exceeds $35 million, or be obligated to provide collateral to the counterparty if the negative
fair  value  of  the  swap  exceeds  $50  million.  On  July  1,  2010,  the  university  deposited  collateral  of
approximately  $2  million  with  the  counterparty,  and  on  July  2,  2010,  it  deposited  an  additional  collateral  of
approximately $1 million.

Notes to the Financial Statements

D. Discretely Presented Component Unit—California Housing Finance Agency

The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), a discretely presented component unit, holds interest-rate
swaps that are derivative instruments.  As of June 30, 2010, the fair value of the swaps is reported as other
noncurrent assets or as other noncurrent liabilities in the statement of net assets. The cumulative gain or loss
on the fair value of the effective swaps is reported as other noncurrent assets or as other noncurrent liabilities
in  the  statement  of  net  assets.  Alternatively,  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  fair  value  of  the  ineffective  swaps  is
reported  as  other  general  revenues  in  the  statement  of  activities.  CalHFA  did  not  pay  or  receive  any  cash
when the swap transactions were initiated except for in-substance assignments. Except as discussed under
rollover risk, CalHFA’s swap agreements contain scheduled reductions to outstanding notional amounts that
are  expected  to  approximately  follow  scheduled  or  anticipated  reductions  in  the  associated  bonds  payable.
Table 40 summarizes the swap fair value activity in the statement of net assets and the statement of activities.

Table 30 includes debt service requirements and net swap payments as of June 30, 2010, for CalHFA. Total
principal, variable interest, and interest rate net swap payments are $3.2 billion, $227 million, and $1.4 billion,
respectively.

Objective: CalHFA has entered into interest-rate swap agreements with various counterparties to protect itself
against rising rates by providing synthetic fixed rates for a like amount of variable-rate bond obligations. The
majority  of  CalHFA’s  interest-rate  swap  transactions  are  structured  to  pay  a  fixed  rate  of  interest  while
receiving a variable rate of interest, with some exceptions. CalHFA previously entered into swaps at a ratio of
65%  of  LIBOR.  Its  current  formula  is  63%  of  LIBOR  plus  a  spread,  currently  0.24%.  The  swap  formula  will
continue  to  be  monitored  for  its  effectiveness  in  case  CalHFA  chooses  to  enter  into  any  future  interest-rate
swaps.  In  addition,  CalHFA  entered  into  eight  basis  swaps  as  a  means  to  change  the  variable-rate  formula
received  from  counterparties  for  $261  million  outstanding  notional  amount  from  65%  of  LIBOR  to  varying
floating rates.

Terms, Fair Value, and Credit Risk: CalHFA uses 13 counterparties for its interest-rate swap transactions. All
of  CalHFA’s  interest-rate  swap  agreements  require  CalHFA  to  post  collateral  if  its  general  obligation  credit
ratings, as issued by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, fall below a certain level or if the fair value of the swaps
fall below a certain threshold. The collateral can be posted in several forms in the amount of the fair value of
the  interest-rate  swaps.  If  CalHFA  does  not  post  collateral,  the  interest-rate  swap  can  be  terminated  by  the
counterparty.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  CalHFA’s  swap  portfolio  has  an  aggregate  negative  fair  value  of
$330 million due to a decline in interest rates. Fair values are as reported by CalHFA’s counterparties and are

133

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

estimated using the zero-coupon method. As CalHFA’s swap portfolio has an aggregate negative fair value,
CalHFA  has  no  net  exposure  to  credit  risk.  CalHFA  has  119  swap  transactions,  with  outstanding  notional
amounts  of  $3.4  billion.  Standard  &  Poor’s  credit  ratings  for  these  counterparties  range  from  A-  to  AAA;
Moody’s credit ratings range from A3 to Aaa.

Interest  Rate  Risk:  CalHFA  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  on  its  fixed-payer  swaps.  As  the  LIBOR  or  the
SIFMA swap index decreases, CalHFA’s net payments on the swaps increase.

Basis Risk: CalHFA’s swaps contain the risk that the floating-rate component of the swap will not match the
floating rate of the underlying bonds. This risk arises because floating rates paid by swap counterparties are
based on indices that consist of market-wide averages, while interest paid on CalHFA’s variable-rate bonds is
specific to individual bond issues. CalHFA’s variable-rate tax-exempt bonds trade at a slight discount to the
SIFMA  index.  For  swaps  associated  with  tax-exempt  bonds  for  which  CalHFA  receives  a  variable-rate
payment based on a percentage of LIBOR, CalHFA is exposed to basis risk if the relationship between SIFMA
and LIBOR converges. As of June 30, 2010, the SIFMA rate was 0.25%, 65% of the one-month LIBOR was
0.22%, and 63% of the one-month LIBOR plus 0.24% was 0.46%.

Termination  Risk:  Counterparties  to  CalHFA’s  interest-rate  swaps  have  termination  rights  that  require
settlement payments by either CalHFA or the counterparty, based on the fair value of the swap.

Rollover Risk: CalHFA is exposed to rollover risk on interest-rate swaps that are hedges of debt that mature or
may  be  terminated  prior  to  the  maturity  of  the  hedged  debt.  When  these  swaps  terminate,  CalHFA  will  be
re-exposed to the risks being hedged by the swaps.

NOTE 18:  INTERFUND BALANCES AND TRANSFERS

A. Interfund Balances

Due from other funds and due to other funds represent short-term interfund receivables and payables resulting
from the time lag between the dates on which goods and services are provided and received and the dates on
which  payments  between  entities  are  made.  In  addition,  interfund  borrowing,  mainly  from  nonmajor
governmental funds and fiduciary funds, is used to meet temporary imbalances of receipts and disbursements
in the General Fund. The amount payable from the fiduciary funds to the General Fund is mainly for unclaimed
property received at the end of the year that will be transferred to the General Fund for its use until claimed.
Table 41 presents the amounts due from and due to other funds.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Interfund receivables and payables are the result of interfund loans that are not expected to be repaid within
one  year.  In  addition  to  the  temporary  interfund  cash-flow  borrowing  shown  in  Table  41,  annual  enacted
budgets provide for long-term loans from many of the State’s special funds—mainly the Transportation Fund
and  nonmajor  governmental  funds—to  the  General  Fund.  The  $2.6  billion  in  Transportation  Fund  loans
payable  from  the  General  Fund  also  includes  $1.8  billion  of  deferred  Proposition  42  transfers  for  traffic
congestion  relief  and  other  direct  loans  from  the  Traffic  Congestion  Relief  Program.  Table  42  presents  the
interfund receivables and payables.

B. Interfund Transfers

As required by law, transfers move money collected by one fund to another fund, which then disburses it. The
General  Fund  and  certain  other  funds  transfer  money  to  support  various  programs  accounted  for  in  other
funds.  The  largest  transfers  from  the  General  Fund  were  $1.4 billion  to  the  Transportation  Fund  for  traffic
congestion relief and $1.6 billion to nonmajor governmental funds for support of trial courts. The Federal Fund
transfer  to  nonmajor  governmental  funds  includes  a  $1.3  billion  transfer  for  unemployment  program
administration.  The  Federal  Fund  also  transferred  $13.3  billion  in  unemployment  subsidy  received  from  the
federal  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  (ARRA)  of  2009  to  the  Unemployment  Programs  Fund.

B. Discretely Presented Component Unit Endowments and Gifts

The  University  of  California,  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  administers  certain  restricted
nonexpendable, restricted expendable, and unrestricted endowments that are included in the related net asset
categories  of  the  government-wide  and  fund  financial  statements.  As  of  June 30,  2010,  the  total  value  of
restricted  and  unrestricted  endowments  and  gifts  was  $9.3 billion  and  $1.3 billion,  respectively.  The
university’s  policy  is  to  retain  appreciation  on  investments  with  the  endowment  after  an  annual  income
distribution.  The  net  appreciation  available  to  meet  future  spending  needs  upon  approval  by  the  Board  of
Regents amounted to $1.3 billion at June 30, 2010. The portion of investment returns earned on endowments
and distributed each year to support current operations is based on a rate approved by the Board of Regents.
In  addition,  the  California  State  University  Auxiliary  Organizations  and  the  University  of  California  Hastings
College  of  the  Law,  nonmajor  component  units,  have  restricted  nonexpendable  and  restricted  expendable
endowments of $730 million and $6 million, respectively.

NOTE 20:  RISK MANAGEMENT

The  primary  government  has  elected,  with  a  few  exceptions,  to  be  self-insured  against  loss  or  liability.
Generally,  the  exceptions  are  when  a  bond  resolution  or  a  contract  requires  the  primary  government  to
purchase commercial insurance for coverage against property loss or liability. There have been no significant
reductions  in  insurance  coverage  from  the  prior  year.  In  addition,  no  insurance  settlement  in  the  last  three
years  has  exceeded  insurance  coverage.  The  primary  government  generally  does  not  maintain  reserves.
Losses  are  covered  by  appropriations  from  each  fund  responsible  for  payment  in  the  year  in  which  the
payment occurs. All claim payments are on a “pay as you go” basis, with workers’ compensation benefits for
self-insured agencies being initially paid by the State Compensation Insurance Fund.

144

Notes to the Financial Statements

The discounted liability for unpaid self-insured workers’ compensation losses is estimated to be $2.8 billion as
of June 30, 2010. This estimate is based on actuarial reviews of the State’s employee workers’ compensation
program  and  includes  indemnity  payments  to  claimants,  as  well  as  all  other  costs  of  providing  workers’
compensation  benefits,  such  as  medical  care  and  rehabilitation.  The  estimate  also  includes  the  liability  for
unpaid services fees, industrial disability leave benefits, and incurred-but-not-reported amounts. The estimated
total liability of approximately $3.9 billion is discounted to $2.8 billion using a 3.5% interest rate. Of the total,
$326  million  is  a  current  liability,  of  which  $207  million  is  included  in  the  General  Fund,  $117  million  in  the
special revenue funds, and $2 million in the internal service funds. The remaining $2.4 billion is reported as
other noncurrent liabilities in the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.

The  University  of  California,  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  is  self-insured  for  medical  malpractice,
workers’ compensation, employee health care, and general liability claims. These risks are subject to various
claim and aggregate limits, with excess liability coverage provided by an independent insurer. Liabilities are
recorded when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
These losses include an estimate for claims that have been incurred but not reported. The estimated liabilities
are based on an independent actuarial determination of the anticipated future payments, discounted at rates
ranging from 3.5% to 5.25%. 

The  California  Public  Employee  Retirement  System  (CalPERS)  through  its  Public  Employees’  Benefits,  a
discretely presented component unit, administers three self-funded health care plans as risk pools available to
all entities that contract for health insurance coverage under the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care
Act. The plans retain all the risk of loss of allowable health claims. Claim liabilities are based on estimates of
the ultimate costs of claims that have been reported but not settled and of claims that have been incurred but
not reported. The estimated claims were calculated by a third-party administrator using a variety of actuarial
and statistical techniques and adjusted for actual experience to produce current estimates that reflect recent
settlements,  claim  frequency,  and  other  economic  and  social  factors.  Adjustments  to  claims  liabilities  are
charged or credited to expense in the periods in which they are made. The other major discretely presented
component units do not have significant liabilities related to self-insurance. 

Table 46 shows the changes in the self-insurance claims liability for the primary government and the discretely
presented component units.

NOTE 21:  NONMAJOR ENTERPRISE SEGMENT INFORMATION

A segment is an identifiable activity reported as or within an enterprise fund or another stand-alone entity for
which  debt  is  outstanding  and  a  revenue  stream  has  been  pledged  in  support  of  that  debt.  In  addition,  to
qualify  as  a  segment,  an  activity  must  be  subject  to  an  external  requirement  to  separately  account  for
revenues, expenses, gains and losses, assets, and liabilities of the activity. All of the activities reported in the
following condensed financial information meet these requirements.

Table  47  presents  the  Condensed  Statement  of  Net  Assets;  the  Condensed  Statement  of  Revenues,
Expenses,  and  Changes  in  Fund  Net  Assets;  and  the  Condensed  Statement  of  Cash  Flows  for  nonmajor
enterprise funds that meet the definition of a segment. The primary sources of revenues for these funds follow.

High  Technology  Education  Fund:  Rental  payments  on  public  buildings  that  are  used  for  educational  and
research purposes related to specific fields of high technology.

State University Dormitory Building Maintenance and Equipment Fund: Charges to students for housing and
parking, and student fees for campus unions.

State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund: Interest charged on loans to communities for construction of
water pollution control facilities and projects.

Housing Loan Fund: Interest payments from low-interest, long-term farm and home mortgage loan contracts
to eligible veterans living in California.

NOTE 22:  NO COMMITMENT DEBT

Certain  debt  of  the  nonmajor  component  units  is  issued  to  finance  activities  such  as  construction  of  new
facilities,  remodeling  of  existing  facilities,  and  acquisition  of  equipment.  This  debt  is  secured  solely  by  the
credit  of  private  and  public  entities  and  is  administered  by  trustees  independent  of  the  State.  As  of
June 30, 2010, these component units had $23.2 billion of debt outstanding, which is not debt of the State.

NOTE 23:  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

A. Litigation

The  primary  government  is  a  party  to  numerous  legal  proceedings,  many  of  which  normally  occur  in
governmental  operations.  To  the  extent  they  existed,  the  following  were  accrued  as  a  liability  in  the
government–wide financial statements: legal proceedings that were decided against the primary government
before  June  30,  2010;  legal  proceedings  that  were  in  progress  as  of  June  30,  2010,  and  were  settled  or
decided  against  the  primary  government  as  of  February  18,  2011;  and  legal  proceedings  having  a  high
probability of resulting in a decision against the primary government as of February 18, 2011, and for which
amounts could be estimated. In the governmental fund financial statements, the portion of the liability that is
expected to be paid within the next 12 months is recorded as a liability of the fund from which payment will be
made.  In  the  proprietary  fund  financial  statements,  the  entire  liability  is  recorded  in  the  fund  from  which
payment will be made.

In addition, the primary government is involved in certain other legal proceedings that, if decided against the
primary government, may impair its revenue sources or require it to make significant expenditures. Because of
the  prospective  nature  of  these  proceedings,  no  provision  for  the  potential  liability  has  been  made  in  the
financial statements. 

Following are the more significant lawsuits pending against the primary government.

The  primary  government  is  the  defendant  in  two  cases  that  raise  essentially  the  same  issues  regarding
Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), which became effective July 1, 2008, and reduced reimbursement to various Medi-Cal
service providers by 10%. Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc. et al. v. Sandra Shewry et al.
was filed on behalf of various Medi-Cal providers and associations to prevent the reimbursement cuts that they
allege violate state and federal Medi-Cal/Medicaid laws. A U. S. district court granted the preliminary injunction
for various providers. Multiple appeals were filed by both sides in response to the injunction and the U.S. Court
of Appeals affirmed the injunction. The State’s petition for certification by the U.S. Supreme Court was granted
on January 18, 2011. California Medical Association et al. v. Sandra Shewry et al. raises essentially the same
issues;  however,  it  was  filed  by  different  providers.  The  preliminary  injunction  was  denied.  The  plaintiff  has
appealed that ruling and it will probably amend its original complaint to add a Supremacy Clause. The case is
now pending a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. Following the enactment of AB 5, the legislature enacted
Assembly  Bill  1183  (AB  1183),  which  terminated  AB  5  as  of  March  2009  and  replaced  the  10%  Medi-Cal
provider  cut  with  a  5%  reimbursement  cut.  A  third  case,  Managed  Pharmacy  Care  et  al.  v.  David
Maxwell-Jolly, was filed to prevent the implementation of AB 1183, contending that it violated the Supremacy
Clause.  A U. S. district court granted the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction and the injunction was affirmed by
the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals.  This  injunction  is  also  included  within  a  petition  for  certification  that  the  U.S.
Supreme Court  granted. A fourth case, California Pharmacists Association et al. v David Maxwell-Jolly, was
also filed to challenge the payment reduction to Adult Day Healthcare Centers (ADHC), pharmacies and other
service providers, and hospital providers participating in the Medi-Cal fee-for-services program under AB 1183.

150

Notes to the Financial Statements

The  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  district  court’s  injunction  of  the  payment  reduction  to  ADHC  and
enjoined the payment reduction of hospital services. The petition for certification to the U.S. Supreme Court
was  granted  on  January  18,  2011.  In  addition,  the  California  Pharmacists  Association  also  challenged  the
Department  of  Health  Care  Services’  use  of  reduced  published  average  wholesale  price  data  to  establish
reimbursement  rates,  the  Legislature’s  amendment  of  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  section  14105.45,  and
enactment  of  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code  section  14105.455.  The  district  court  granted  preliminary
judgement  for  the  plaintiff  with  respect  to  sections  14105.45  and  14105.455,  and  denied  judgement  with
respect  to  the  use  of  average  wholesale  data.  Both  parties  filed  appeals  and  the  case  is  stayed  pending  a
ruling from the Supreme Court. The potential shared cost between the State and the federal government if the
plaintiffs prevail in all these cases would be approximately $1 billion annually.

The primary government is a defendant in four cases regarding the constitutionality of a fee imposed on limited
liability companies (LLC). In Northwest Energetic Services, LLC v. Franchise Tax Board, the Court of Appeal
found the fee unconstitutional only as applied to the plaintiff. The primary government has already begun to
pay refunds to LLCs with the same facts as Northwest who have no income earned inside California. In Ventas
Finance  I,  LLC  v.  Franchise  Tax  Board,  the  Court  of  Appeal  also  ruled  that  the  fee  is  unconstitutional  as
applied to the plaintiff, but it awarded only a partial refund because Ventas received income from both inside
and outside of California. The plaintiff filed a petition requesting a review of the case by the U. S. Supreme
Court; the petition was denied. The third case, Bakersfield Mall, LLC v. Franchise Tax Board, is still pending. It
raised  the  same  constitutional  issues  as  Northwest  and  Ventas,  but  initially  pertained  to  LLCs  that  conduct
business solely within California. Bakersfield Mall, LLC later amended its complaint to reflect the fact that not
all of its income is derived within the State, making it similar to the Ventas case. This plaintiff also intended to
bring  a  class  action  suit  for  refund  on  behalf  of  all  similarly  situated  LLCs  and  to  declare  the  LLC  fee
unconstitutional. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that Bakersfield Mall, LLC did not follow mandatory class
action  claim  procedures.  The  fourth  case,  CA–Centerside  II,  LLC  v.  Franchise  Tax  Board,  is  pending  in  the
trial court. It raised the same constitutional issues as Northwest and Ventas, and alleges that the LLC fee is
unconstitutional regarding any activities, whether in–state or out–of–state. Actual and expected future claims
for refunds from LLCs are estimated to be approximately $600 million plus interest. The Franchise Tax Board
estimates the actual amount of refunds to be paid will be $100 million plus interest.

In River Garden Retirement Home v. Franchise Tax Board, the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the
penalty  assessed  under  the  State’s  tax  amnesty  program.  Under  the  amnesty  program,  for  taxable  years
beginning before January 1, 2003, taxpayers who had not paid or had underpaid an eligible tax could agree to
pay the tax and waive their rights to claim refunds. In exchange, certain penalties and fees associated with the
unpaid  taxes  would  be  waived  and  no  criminal  actions  would  be  brought  for  the  taxable  years  for  which
amnesty  was  allowed.  The  program  also  imposed  a  new  penalty  equal  to  50%  of  accrued  interest  as  of
March 31, 2005, on any unpaid tax liabilities ultimately determined to be due for taxable years 2002 and earlier
for which amnesty could have been requested. The trial court granted judgment for the State. The plaintiff filed
a petition for review to the California Supreme Court, which was denied. All state court proceedings have now
been completed.

the 

first  executive  order, 

furlough,  without  pay,  of  state  employees.  The 

The  primary  government  is  the  defendant  in  numerous  cases  regarding  the  Governor’s  executive  orders
directing 
issued  on
December  19,  2008,  directed  furloughs  of  two  days  per  month,  effective  February  1,  2009,  through
June 30, 2010.  The second order, issued on July 1, 2009, required a third furlough day per month, effective
through June 30, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the Governor issued a new executive order requiring furloughs for
three days per month beginning August 1, 2010, until a new 2010-11 fiscal year budget was adopted and the
Director  of  Finance  determined  that  the  State  had  sufficient  cash  flow  to  pay  for  essential  services.  The
furlough  cases  are  at  various  stages  in  the  court  process;  following  are  highlights  of  some  of  the  cases.
Various  plaintiffs  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Governor  and  other  state  officers  and  argued  that  as  the  State

151

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Compensation  Insurance  Fund  (SCIF)  is  financially  and  administratively  independent,  the  furlough  order
should not include its employees. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled that the Governor should not
have  furloughed  state  employees  working  for  the  SCIF.  All  parties  related  to  the  SCIF  furloughs  have
submitted a stipulated request for dismissal of the appellate cases. The California Correctional Peace Officers
Association (CCPOA) also sued the Governor and other state officers, arguing that furloughs are a de facto
salary cut that is in violation of state law, as its members cannot take their furlough days off due to operational
needs. The Alameda County Superior Court ruled in favor of the CCPOA, and ordered the State to pay the
CCPOA’s  members  for  all  hours  worked  for  which  furlough  credits  have  not  yet  been  used.  On
October 4, 2010, the California Supreme Court, ruling in three consolidated cases, upheld the validity of the
two days per month furloughs implemented by the Governor’s December 2008 order on the grounds that the
legislature  had  ratified  these  furloughs  in  enacting  the  2008  budget  revision.  The  potential  outcome  for  the
other cases is uncertain.

The primary government is the defendant in both California Redevelopment Association et al. v. Michael C.
Genest  et  al.  and  County  of  Los  Angeles,  et  al.  v.  Genest,  et  al.  These  two  cases  challenge  the
constitutionality of Assembly Bill X4-26 that requires that redevelopment agencies remit a total of $1.7 billion in
2009-10  fiscal  year  and  $350  million  in  2010-11  fiscal  year  to  a  county  Supplemental  Education  Revenue
Augmentation Fund to be used by local schools. The State successfully defeated the claims in the superior
court  and  is  currently  defending  against  the  claims  in  the  Court  of  Appeal.  If  the  Court  of  Appeal  grants
judgment for the plaintiff, the State would need to pay the challenged amount to the schools from the General
Fund. 

The University of California, the State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF), the California Housing Finance
Agency  (CalHFA),  the  Public  Employees’  Benefits  Fund,  and  certain  nonmajor  discretely  presented
component  units  are  contingently  liable  in  connection  with  claims  and  contracts,  including  those  currently  in
litigation,  arising  in  the  normal  course  of  their  activities.  Although  there  are  inherent  uncertainties  in  any
litigation, the management and the general counsel of the University of California, SCIF, CalHFA, the Public
Employees’ Benefit Fund, and certain nonmajor discretely presented component units are of the opinion that
the  outcome  of  such  matters  either  will  not  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  statements  or  cannot  be
estimated at this time. 

B. Federal Audit Exceptions

The primary government receives substantial funding from the federal government in the form of grants and
other federal assistance. The primary government, the University of California, CalHFA, and certain nonmajor
discretely presented component units are entitled to these resources only if they comply with the terms and
conditions of the grants and contracts and with the applicable federal laws and regulations; they may spend
these  resources  only  for  eligible  purposes.  If  audits  disclose  exceptions,  the  primary  government,  the
University  of  California,  CalHFA,  and  certain  nonmajor  discretely  presented  component  units  may  incur  a
liability to the federal government.

NOTE 24:  PENSION TRUSTS 
 
Two  retirement  systems,  the  California  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  (CalPERS)  and  the  California
State  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (CalSTRS),  which  are  fiduciary  component  units,  are  included  in  the
pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds  column  of  the  fiduciary  funds  and  similar  component  units’
financial  statements.  The  pension  liability  for  all  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds  was
determined  in  accordance  with  GASB  Statement  No.  27,  Accounting  for  Pensions  by  State  and  Local
Government Employers. The amounts of the pension liability for all pension and other employee benefit trust
funds are presented in Table 49 as the net pension obligation (NPO) as of June 30, 2010. The investments of
these fiduciary component units are presented in Table 6 in Note 3, Deposits and Investments.

CalPERS  administers  four  defined  benefit  retirement  plans:  the  Public  Employees’  Retirement  Fund,  the
Judges’  Retirement  Fund,  the  Judges’  Retirement  Fund  II,  and  the  Legislators’  Retirement  Fund.  CalPERS
also  administers  three  defined  contribution  plans:  the  State  Peace  Officers’  and  Firefighters’  Defined
Contribution  Plan  Fund,  the  Public  Agency  Deferred  Compensation  Program,  and  the  public  employee
Supplemental Contributions Program Fund. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report that includes
financial statements and required supplementary information for these plans. This report may be obtained by
writing  to  the  California  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System,  Fiscal  Services  Division,  P.O.  Box  942703,
Sacramento, California 94229 or by visiting the CalPERS Web site at www.CalPERS.ca.gov.

CalPERS uses the accrual basis of accounting. Member contributions are recognized in the period in which
the contributions are due. Employer contributions are recorded when due and the employer has made a formal
commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits under the defined benefit plans and refunds are recognized
when due and payable in accordance with the terms of each plan.

CalSTRS  administers  four  defined  benefit  retirement  plans  within  the  State  Teachers’  Retirement  Plan:  the
Defined Benefit Program (DB Program), the Defined Benefit Supplement Program, the Cash Balance Benefit
Program,  and  the  Replacement  Benefit  Program.  CalSTRS  also  offers  the  Pension2  Program  through  a
third-party  administrator.  The  Pension2  Program  is  a  tax-deferred  defined  contribution  plan  meeting  the
requirements  of  Internal  Revenue  Code  Sections  403(b)  and  457.  The  Teachers’  Health  Benefits  Fund
provides postemployment health benefits to retired members of the DB Program. CalSTRS issues a publicly
available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for these
plans. This report may be obtained from the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, P.O. Box 15275,
Sacramento, California 95851.

CalSTRS uses the accrual basis of accounting. Member contributions are recognized in the period in which
the  contributions  are  due.  Employer  and  primary  government  contributions  are  recognized  when  due  and
when the employer or the primary government has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions.
Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable, in accordance with the retirement and benefits
programs.

A. Public Employees’ Retirement Fund

1. Fund Information

Plan  Description:  CalPERS  administers  the  Public  Employees’  Retirement  Fund  (PERF),  which  is  an  agent
multiple-employer  defined  benefit  retirement  plan.  Employers  participating  in  the  PERF  include  the  primary
government  and  certain  discretely  presented  component  units,  61 school  employers,  and  1,482  public
agencies as of June 30, 2010.

The amount by which the actuarial accrued liability exceeded the actuarial value of assets in the PERF for the
primary government and other participating agencies was $49.1 billion at June 30, 2009. This is a result of the
difference  between  the  actuarial  value  of  assets  of  $245.0  billion  and  the  actuarial  accrued  liability  of
$294.0 billion. Contributions are either actuarially determined or determined by statute.

2. Employer’s Information

Plan Description: The primary government and certain discretely presented component units contribute to the
PERF. CalPERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent of the primary government and the
other member agencies. The discretely presented component units’ participation in the PERF is not a material
portion  of  the  program.  The  primary  government  employees  served  by  the  PERF  include:  first-tier  and
second-tier miscellaneous and industrial employees, California Highway Patrol employees, peace officers and
firefighters,  and  other  safety  members.  In  the  June  30,  2009  actuarial  valuation,  the  payroll  for  primary
government employees covered by the PERF for fiscal year 2007-08 was $16.3 billion.

All employees in a covered class of employment who work half-time or more are eligible to participate in the
PERF. The PERF provides benefits based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and benefit
formula.  Vesting  occurs  after  five years  or  after  ten  years  for  second-tier  employees.  The  PERF  provides
death, disability, and survivor benefits. The benefit provisions are established by statute.

Funding  Policy:  Benefits  are  funded  by  contributions  from  members  and  the  primary  government  and  by
earnings  from  investments.  Member  and  primary  government  contributions  are  a  percentage  of  applicable
member  compensation.  Member  rates  are  defined  by  law  and  based  on  the  primary  government’s  benefit
formula.  The  primary  government  contribution  rates  are  determined  by  periodic  actuarial  valuations  or  by
statute. 

Employees,  with  the  exception  of  employees  in  the  second-tier  plans  and  the  State’s  Alternate  Retirement
Program, contribute to the fund based on the required contribution rates. The contribution rates of active plan
members are based on a percentage of salary over a monthly base compensation amount of $133 to $863.
Employees’ required contributions vary from 5.0% to 8.0% of their salary over the base compensation amount.

154

Notes to the Financial Statements

All of the primary government employees served by the PERF are now covered by group term life insurance.

For the year ended June 30, 2010, the annual pension cost (APC) and the amount of contributions made by
the primary government were each $2.9 billion. The APC and the percentage of APC contributed for the last
three years are shown in Table 49. Actuarial valuations of the PERF are performed annually. Information from
the  last  valuation,  which  was  performed  as  of  June  30,  2009,  is  also  shown  in  Table  49  for  the
primary government.

The  Schedule  of  Funding  Progress,  presented  as  required  supplementary  information  (RSI)  following  the
notes  to  the  financial  statements,  presents  multiyear  trend  information  about  whether  the  actuarial  value  of
plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. 

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: In the June 30, 2009 actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal
cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 7.75% investment rate of return, projected salary
increases  of  3.45%  to  19.95%,  depending  on  duration  of  service,  and  postemployment  benefit  increases  of
2.00% or 3.00%, compounded annually. The projected salary increases include a 3.00% inflation assumption.
The unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll
on a closed basis.

B. Judges’ Retirement Fund

Plan  Description:  CalPERS  administers 
is  an  agent
multiple-employer  defined  benefit  retirement  plan.  The  JRF  membership  includes  justices  of  the  Supreme
Court  and  courts  of  appeal,  as  well  as  judges  of  superior  courts,  appointed  or  elected  prior  to
November 9, 1994.  There  are  59  employers  participating  in  the  JRF  for  the  year  ended  June 30, 2010.  The
payroll for employees covered by the JRF for the year ended June 30, 2010, was approximately $89 million.
The primary government pays the employer contributions for all employees covered by the JRF.

the  Judges’  Retirement  Fund  (JRF),  which 

The  JRF  provides  benefits  based  on  a  member’s  years  of  service,  age,  final  compensation,  and  benefit
formula. Vesting occurs after five years. The JRF provides death, disability, and survivor benefits. Benefits for
the JRF are established by the Judges’ Retirement Law.

155

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Funding Policy: The contribution rate of active plan members is defined by law and is based on a percentage
of salary over a base compensation amount. For the year ended June 30, 2010, the required member rate for
the JRF was 8.0%.

The  contributions  of  the  primary  government  to  the  JRF  are  made  pursuant  to  state  statute  and  are  not
actuarially  determined.  As  of  June 30, 2010,  employer  contributions  are  required  to  be  8.0%  of  applicable
member compensation. Other funding to meet benefit payment requirements of the JRF is currently provided
by: filing fees, which require varying amounts, depending on fee rate and number of filings; investments, which
earn  the  current  yield  on  short-term  investments;  and  the  primary  government’s  balancing  contributions,  as
required  by  the  Judges’  Retirement  Law.  The  balancing  contributions  are  an  amount  at  least  equal  to  the
estimated benefits payable during the ensuing fiscal year, less the sum of the estimated member contributions
during the ensuing fiscal year and net assets available for benefits at the beginning of the fiscal year (“pay as
you go” basis).

The APC and the amount of employer contributions made to the JRF for the year ended June 30, 2010, were
$662 million  and  $185  million,  respectively.  The  NPO  of  the  JRF  at  June 30,  2010,  was  $2.7  billion,  an
increase of $477 million over last year’s balance of $2.2 billion. The APC is comprised of $1.2 billion for the
annual  required  contribution  (ARC),  $156 million  for  interest  on  the  NPO,  and  a  negative  $661  million
adjustment to the ARC. An actuarial valuation of the JRF’s assets and liabilities is made annually. The APC,
the percentage of APC contributed, and the NPO for the last three years are shown in Table 49. Information
on  the  last  valuation,  which  was  performed  as  of  June 30, 2009,  is  shown  in  Table  49.  The  aggregate  cost
method that was used for the June 30, 2009 valuation does not identify or separately amortize the unfunded
actuarial  accrued  liability;  therefore,  the  information  about  funded  status  in  Table  49  is  prepared  using  the
entry  age  actuarial  cost  method  and  is  intended  to  serve  as  a  surrogate  for  the  funded  status  and  funding
progress of the plan.

The Schedule of Funding Progress, presented as RSI following the notes to the financial statements, presents
multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over
time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. 

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions:  In the June 30, 2009 actuarial valuation, the aggregate cost method was
used.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included  a  4.50%  investment  rate  of  return,  projected  salary  increases  of
3.25%,  and  postemployment  benefit  increases  of  3.25%.  The  projected  salary  increases  include  a  3.00%
inflation assumption.  

C. Judges’ Retirement Fund II

Plan  Description:  CalPERS  administers  the  Judges’  Retirement  Fund  II  (JRF  II),  which  is  an  agent
multiple-employer defined benefit retirement plan. The membership of the JRF II includes justices of the same
courts covered by the JRF who were appointed or elected on or subsequent to November 9, 1994. There are
59 employers participating in the JRF II. The payroll for employees covered by the JRF II for the year ended
June 30, 2010, was approximately $208 million. The primary government pays the employer contributions for
all employees covered by the JRF II. 

The  JRF  II  provides  benefits  based  on  a  member’s  years  of  service,  age,  final  compensation,  and  benefit
formula. Vesting occurs after five years. The JRF II provides death, disability, and survivor benefits. Benefits
for the JRF II are established by the Judges’ Retirement System II Law.

Notes to the Financial Statements

Funding  Policy:  The  required  contribution  rate  of  active  plan  members  is  defined  by  law  and  is  based  on  a
percentage  of  salary  over  a  base  compensation  amount.  For  the  year  ended  June 30, 2010,  the  required
member  rate  for  the  JRF  II  was  8.0%,  and  the  primary  government’s  contribution  rate  for  the  JRF  II  was
20.36% of applicable member compensation.

Actuarial valuations for the JRF II are required to be carried out annually. The legislated primary government
contribution rate is adjusted periodically as part of the annual Budget Act, in order to maintain or restore the
actuarial soundness of the fund.

For  the  year  ended  June 30, 2010,  the  amount  of  contributions  made  for  the  JRF  II  were  approximately
$42.6 million,  which  is  less  than  the  actuarially  determined  APC  and  required  contribution  of  approximately
$44.8 million. The APC and the percentage of APC contributed for the year ended June 30, 2010, are shown
in  Table  49.  Information  on  the  last  valuation,  which  was  performed  as  of  June 30, 2009,  is  also  shown  in
Table 49.

The Schedule of Funding Progress, presented as RSI following the notes to the financial statements, presents
multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over
time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. 

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: In the June 30, 2009 actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal
cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 7.25% investment rate of return, projected salary
increases of 3.25%, and postemployment benefit increases of 3.00%. The projected salary increases include a
3.00% inflation assumption. The UAAL is being amortized as a level percentage of payroll on a closed basis
over 26 years.

D. Legislators’ Retirement Fund

Plan  Description:  CalPERS  administers  the  Legislators’  Retirement  Fund  (LRF),  which  is  a  single-employer
defined benefit retirement plan. The eligible membership of the LRF includes state legislators serving in the
legislature prior to  November 7, 1990, constitutional officers, and legislative statutory officers. For the fiscal
year  ending  June 30,  2010,  no  statutory  contribution  was  required,  based  on  the  June  30,  2008  valuation.

The  LRF  provides  benefits  based  on  a  member’s  years  of  service,  age,  final  compensation,  and  benefit
formula. Vesting occurs after five years. The plan provides death, disability, and survivor benefits. Benefits for
the LRF are established by the Legislators’ Retirement Law. No current legislators are eligible to participate in
the  LRF.  The  only  active  members  in  the  LRF  are  13  constitutional  officers  (including  the  Insurance
Commissioner and members of the Board of Equalization) and legislative statutory officers.

Funding Policy: The employer contribution requirements of the LRF are based on actuarially determined rates.
An  actuarial  valuation  of  the  LRF’s  assets  and  liabilities  is  required  at  least  every  two  years.  Member
contribution  rates  are  defined  by  law.  For  the  year  ended  June 30, 2010,  employee  contributions  were  not
required  because  the  plan  was  superfunded.  “Superfunded”  means  that  the  plan’s  actuarial  value  of  assets
exceeds  the  present  value  of  future  benefits  for  current  members.  However,  some  members  made
contributions toward military service and prior service.

The NPO of the LRF on June 30, 2010, was approximately $10 million. There was no APC because the ARC
equaled  zero  and  the  interest  on  the  NPO  closely  approximated  the  adjustment  to  the  ARC.  The  APC,  the
percentage  of  APC  contributed,  and  the  NPO  for  the  last  three  years  are  shown  in  Table  49.  An  actuarial
valuation  of  the  LRF’s  assets  and  liabilities  is  required  at  least  every  two  years.  Information  on  the  last

157

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

valuation, which was performed as of June 30, 2009, is also shown in Table 49. The aggregate cost method
that was used for the June 30, 2009 valuation does not identify or separately amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued  liability;  therefore,  the  information  about  funded  status  in  Table  49  is  prepared  using  the  entry  age
actuarial cost method and is intended to serve as a surrogate for the funded status and funding progress of the
plan.

The Schedule of Funding Progress, presented as RSI following the notes to the financial statements, presents
multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over
time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. 

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: In the June 30, 2009 actuarial valuation, the aggregate cost method was
used.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included  a  7.00%  investment  rate  of  return,  projected  salary  increases  of
3.25%,  and  postemployment  benefit  increases  of  3.00%.  The  projected  salary  increases  include  a  3.00%
inflation assumption. 

E. State Peace Officers’ and Firefighters’ Defined Contribution Plan Fund

Plan Description: CalPERS administers the State Peace Officers’ and Firefighters’ Defined Contribution Plan
Fund (SPOFF), which is a defined contribution pension plan. The plan is a qualified money purchase pension
plan under Section 401(a) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is intended to supplement the retirement
benefits  provided  by  the  Public  Employees’  Retirement  Fund  to  eligible  peace  officers  and  firefighters
employed by the State of California.

Funding  Policy:  Contributions  to  the  plan  are  funded  entirely  by  the  primary  government  with  a  contribution
rate of 2.0% of the employee’s base pay, not to exceed contribution limits established by the Internal Revenue
Code.  Contribution  requirements  are  established  and  may  be  amended  through  a  memorandum  of
understanding  from  the  State  of  California  Department  of  Personnel  Administration.  These  contributions,  as
well as the participant’s share of the net earnings of the fund, are credited to the participant’s account. For the
year  ended  June 30, 2010,  contributions  by  the  primary  government  to  the  SPOFF  were  approximately
$52 million.

Contributions are invested in the CalPERS Moderate Asset Allocation Fund. Distributions are allowed only at
retirement or permanent separation from all State employment. The benefits paid to a participant will depend
only  on  the  amount  contributed  to  the  participant’s  account  and  earnings  on  the  value  of  the  participant’s
account. Plan provisions are established by and may be amended by statute. At June 30, 2010, there were
40,020 participants in the SPOFF. 

F. Teachers’ Retirement Fund

Plan  Description:  CalSTRS  administers  the  Teachers’  Retirement  Fund,  which  is  an  employee  benefit  trust
fund  created  to  administer  the  State  Teachers’  Retirement  Plan  (STRP).  The  STRP  is  a  defined  benefit
pension plan that provides for retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Four programs comprise the STRP:
the Defined Benefit (DB) Program, the Defined Benefit Supplement (DBS) Program, the Cash Balance (CB)
Benefit Program, and the Replacement Benefit (RB) Program. The STRP is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer,
defined-benefit retirement plan that provides pension benefits to teachers and certain other employees of the
California public school system.

Membership in the DB Program is mandatory for all employees meeting the eligibility requirements. The DB
Program  provides  benefits  based  on  a  member’s  age,  final  compensation,  and  years  of  service.  Vesting

158

Notes to the Financial Statements

occurs after five years. In addition, the retirement program provides benefits to members upon disability and to
survivors upon the death of eligible members. The Teachers’ Retirement Law establishes the benefits for the
DB Program. At June 30, 2010, the DB Program had 1,604 contributing employers and as of June 30, 2009,
had  459,009  active  and  156,207  inactive  program  members  and  232,617  benefit  recipients.  The  primary
government is a nonemployer contributor to the DB Program. The payroll for employees covered by the DB
Program for the year ended June 30, 2010, was approximately $27.2 billion.

Membership in the DBS Program is automatic for all members of the DB Program. The DBS Program provides
benefits based on the balance of member accounts. Vesting occurs immediately. The Teachers’ Retirement
Law establishes the benefits for the DBS Program. The primary government does not contribute to the DBS
Program.

The  CB  Benefit  Program  is  designed  for  employees  of  California  public  schools  who  are  hired  to  perform
creditable service for less than 50% of the full-time equivalent for the position. Employer participation in the CB
Benefit  Program  is  optional.  However,  if  the  employer  elects  to  offer  the  CB  Benefit  Program,  each  eligible
employee will automatically be covered by the CB Benefit Program unless the member elects to participate in
the DB Program or an alternative plan provided by the employer within 60 days of hire. At June 30, 2010, the
CB Benefit Program had 33 contributing school districts and 31,966 contributing participants.

The  RB  Program  is  a  qualified  excess  benefits  arrangement  for  DB  Program  members  that  is  administered
through  a  separate  pension  trust  apart  from  the  other  three  STRP  programs  and  was  established  in
accordance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 415(m).  IRC Section 415(b) imposes a dollar limit on
the  annual  retirement  benefits  an  individual  may  receive  from  a  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  The
program is funded as needed.  Monthly contributions that would otherwise be credited to the DB program are
instead  credited  to  the  RB  Program  to  fund  monthly  program  costs.    Monthly  employer  contributions  are
received and paid to members in amounts equal to the benefits not paid as a result of IRC Section 415(b),
subject  to  withholding  for  any  applicable  income  or  employment  taxes.    At  June  30,  2010,  the  RB  Program
had168 participants.

Funding  Policy:  DB  Program  benefits  are  funded  by  contributions  from  members,  employers,  the  primary
government, and earnings from investments. Members and employers contribute a percentage of applicable
member  earnings.  The  Teachers’  Retirement  Law  governs  member  rates,  employer  contribution  rates,  and
primary government contributions.

rate  of  members 

is  6.00%  of  creditable  compensation 

The  DB  Program  contribution 
through
December 31, 2010,  increasing  to  8.00% thereafter  for  service  less  than  or  equal  to  one  year  of  creditable
service  per  fiscal  year.  The  employer  contribution  rate  is  8.25%  of  creditable  compensation  for  service  less
than or equal to one year of creditable service per fiscal year. For service in excess of one year within one
fiscal year, the employer contribution rate is 0.25%. In fiscal year 2009-10, the General Fund contribution was
2.017% of total creditable compensation of the fiscal year ending in the prior calendar year. Education Code
section 22955(b) states that the General Fund will contribute additional quarterly payments at a contribution
rate  of  0.524%  of  creditable  earnings  of  the  fiscal  year  ending  in  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year
when there is an unfunded obligation or a normal cost deficit. The percentage is adjusted up to 0.25% per year
to  reflect  the  contributions  required  to  fund  the  unfunded  obligation  or  the  normal  cost  deficit.  However,  the
transfer may not exceed 1.505% of creditable compensation from the immediately preceding calendar year.
The  normal  cost  deficit  is  the  difference  between  the  normal  cost  rate  and  the  member  and  employer
contributions, which equal 16.00% of creditable compensation. Based on the most recent actuarial valuation,
as  of  June  30,  2009,  no  normal  cost  deficit  or  unfunded  obligation  exists  for  benefits  in  place  as  of
July 1, 1990. Therefore, the General Fund is not required to contribute the additional quarterly payments at a
contribution rate of 0.524% starting October 1, 2010.

159

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

The DBS Program member contribution rate is 2.0% of creditable compensation for service less than or equal
to one year of creditable service per fiscal year. For service in excess of one year within one fiscal year, the
member contribution rate is 8.0% and the employer rate is 8.0%.

For the year ended June 30, 2010, the APC for the DB Program was approximately $4.9 billion; the employer
and primary government contributions were approximately $2.1 billion and $563 million, respectively. The APC
and the percentage of APC contributed for the last three years are shown in Table 49. Actuarial valuations of
the DB Program are performed annually. Information from the last valuation is shown in Table 49.

G. CalSTRS Pension2 Program

Plan Description: CalSTRS administers the Pension2 Program, which is comprised of the IRC 403(b) and 457
programs, through a third-party administrator. The Pension2 is a defined contribution plan and is open to any
employee  who  is  eligible  to  participate.  Contributions  to  the  program  are  voluntary;  however,  the  Internal
Revenue  Code  does  impose  a  maximum  amount  that  can  be  contributed  annually.  At  June 30, 2010,  the
Pension2  IRC  403(b)  and  457  programs  had  approximately  668  and  11  participating  employers  (school
districts) and approximately 6,226 and 94 plan members, respectively.

H. Teachers’ Health Benefits Fund

Plan  Description:  CalSTRS  administers  the  Teachers’  Health  Benefits  Fund  (THBF),  which  was  established
pursuant to Chapter 1032, Statutes of 2000 (SB 1435), to provide the Medicare Premium Payment Program
for eligible retired members of the DB Program. At June 30, 2010, there were 7,618 benefit recipients.

Funding Policy: The THBF is funded as needed from the monthly DB Program statutory employer contribution
that  exceeds  the  amount  needed  to  finance  the  liabilities  of  the  DB  Program  based  on  the  June  30, 2000
actuarial valuation of the DB Program.

The aggregate cost method is used to determine the annual required contribution of the employer for the Judges’ Retirement Fund and the Legislators’
Retirement  Fund.  Because  this  method  does  not  identify  or  separately  amortize  unfunded  actuarial  liabilities,  information  about  funded  status  is
prepared using the entry age cost method and is intended to serve as a surrogate for the funded status of the plan.
The State is a non-employer contributor to the State Teacher’s Retirement Defined Benefit Program Fund, a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan. The
annual  pension  cost  includes  the  amount  related  to  both  the  State  and  the  local  government  employers. The  notion  of  NPO  does  not  apply  to  cost-
sharing  employer  plans.  According  to  the  provisions  of  the  Education  Code,  the  State  and  local  government  employers  contributed  $563  million  and
$2.1 billion,  respectively,  for  the  year  ending  June  30,  2010.  Based  on  the  most  recent  actuarial  valuation,  dated  June  30,  2009,  current  statutory
contributions  are  sufficient  to  fund  normal  costs  but  are  not  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  amortize  the  unfunded  actuarial  obligation.  However,  future
estimates of the actuarial unfunded obligation may change due to market performance, legislative actions, and other experience that may differ from the
actuarial assumptions.

NOTE 25:  POSTEMPLOYMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFITS

A.  State of California Other Postemployment Benefits Plan

Plan  Description:  The  primary  government  and  certain  discretely  presented  component  units  provide  health
benefits  (medical  and  prescription  drug  benefits)  and  dental  benefits  to  annuitants  of  retirement  systems
through a substantive single-employer defined benefit plan to which the primary government contributes as an
employer  (State  substantive  plan).  The  primary  government  also  offers  life  insurance,  long-term  care,  and
vision benefits to retirees; however, because these benefits are completely paid for by the retirees, the primary
government  has  no  liability.  The  discretely  presented  component  units  represent  3.3%  of  plan  participation.
The design of health and dental benefit plans can be amended by the California Public Employees’ Retirement
System  (CalPERS)  Board  of  Administration  and  the  Department  of  Personnel  Administration,  respectively.
Employer  and  retiree  contributions  are  governed  by  the  primary  government  and  can  be  amended  by  the
primary government through the Legislature. The plan contributes to the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit
Trust Fund (CERBTF). The CERBTF is an agent multiple-employer irrevocable trust fund for the prefunding of
health, dental, and other non-pension benefits. CalPERS reports on the CERBTF as part of its annual financial
statements, which can be downloaded from the CalPERS Web site.

Fifty-eight  county  superior  courts  (trial  courts)  are  included  in  the  primary  government.  However,  each  trial
court  is  a  separate  employer  for  GASB  Statement  45  reporting  purposes.  Fifty-two  trial  courts  have  a
single-employer  defined  benefit  plan,  five  trial  courts  (Fresno,  Modoc,  San  Benito,  San  Bernardino,  and
Stanislaus) have no plan, and one trial court (San Diego) has a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit
plan. These plans have separate biennial actuarial valuations. Forty-eight plans are not accounted for in a trust
fund  and  do  not  issue  separate  reports.  Five  trial  courts  (Lassen,  Orange,  San  Diego,  Sonoma,  and  Yolo)
each contribute to one of four trust funds that issue separate reports.

To be eligible for these benefits, primary government first-tier plan annuitants must retire on or after age 50
with at least five years of service, and second-tier plan annuitants must retire on or after attaining age 55 with
at least 10 years of service. In addition, annuitants must retire within 120 days of separation from employment
to be eligible to receive these benefits. During the 2009-10 fiscal year, approximately 146,300 annuitants were
enrolled  to  receive  health  benefits  and  approximately  121,900  annuitants  were  enrolled  to  receive  dental
benefits.  During  the  2009-10  fiscal  year,  the  trial  courts  had  approximately  3,300  enrolled  retirees  and
spouses.

Funding  Policy:  The  contribution  requirements  of  plan  members  and  the  State  are  established  and  may  be
amended  by  the  Legislature.  In  accordance  with  the  California  Government  Code,  the  State  generally  pays
100%  of  the  health  insurance  cost  for  annuitants,  plus  90%  of  the  additional  premium  required  for  the
enrollment of family members of annuitants. Although the California Government Code does not specify the
State’s  contribution  toward  dental  insurance  costs,  the  State  generally  pays  all  or  a  portion  of  the  dental
insurance cost for annuitants, depending upon the completed years of credited state service at retirement and
the  dental  coverage  selected  by  the  annuitant.  The  State  funds  the  cost  of  providing  health  and  dental
insurance  to  annuitants  primarily  on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis  with  a  small  amount  of  prefunding  for  California
Highway Patrol members.  The maximum 2010 monthly State contribution was $493 for one-party coverage,
$936 for two-party coverage, and $1,202 for family coverage. 

Each  of  the  trial  courts  determines  its  respective  retirees’  benefits  and  benefit  levels  as  well  as  the  funding
policy for its respective plan. Forty-eight trial courts fund retirees’ benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The 2010
monthly  contribution  rate  for  the  trial  courts  with  single-employer  defined  benefit  plans—the  latest  year  for
which information is available—ranged from zero to $2,120. Two trial courts (Lassen and Yolo) contribute at

least the annual required contribution (ARC) of the employer, an amount actuarially determined in accordance
with the parameters of GASB Statement 45. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing
basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (or funding
excess)  over  a  period  not  to  exceed  30  years.  Orange  contributes  3.50%  of  payroll,  with  at  least  the  ARC
contributed  each  year.  Sonoma  contributes  $50,000  per  month  to  an  other  postemployment  benefit  (OPEB)
trust and pays a portion of ongoing benefit payments directly from trial court assets. San Diego, a cost-sharing
multiple-employer  defined  benefit  plan,  had  a  contribution  rate  of  1.80%  of  annual  covered  pension  payroll.
For  the  year  ended  June 30,  2010,  the  State  contributed  $1.4  billion  toward  annuitants’  health  and  dental
benefits.  Of  this  amount,  the  trial  courts  represent  $25  million  and  certain  discretely  presented  component
units represent $42 million.

Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation: The State’s annual OPEB cost (expense) is calculated based
on the ARC. Table 50 presents the State’s OPEB cost, the percentage of annual OPEB cost contributed to the
plan, and the net OPEB obligation for the year ended June 30, 2010, and the  two preceding years, including
trial courts.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Funded Status and Funding Progress: As of June 30, 2010—the most recent actuarial valuation date for the
State  substantive  plan—the  actuarial  accrued  liability  (AAL),  for  benefits  was  $59.9 billion,  and  the  actuarial
value  of  assets  was  $5 million,  resulting  in  an  unfunded  actuarial  accrued  liability  (UAAL)  of  negative
$59.9 billion. The covered payroll (annual payroll of active employees covered by the plan) was $17.5 billion,
and the ratio of the UAAL to the covered payroll was negative 342%.

For  the  trial  courts,  as  of  July  1,  2009—the  most  recent  actuarial  valuation  date—the  AAL  for  benefits  was
$1.5 billion, and the actuarial value of assets was $9 million, resulting in an UAAL of negative $1.5 billion. The
covered payroll was $1.0 billion, and the ratio of the UAAL to covered payroll was negative 147%.

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions
about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about mortality
and  the  healthcare  cost  trend.  Amounts  determined  regarding  the  plan’s  funded  status  and  the  employer’s
annual  required  contributions  are  subject  to  continual  revision  as  actual  results  are  compared  with  past
expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as
required  supplementary  information  following  the  notes  to  the  financial  statements,  presents  multiyear  trend
information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to
the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions:  Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the
substantive  plan  (the  plan  as  understood  by  the  employer  and  the  plan  members)  and  include  the  types  of
benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between
the  employer  and  plan  members  to  that  point.  The  actuarial  methods  and  assumptions  used  are  consistent
with a long-term perspective.

In the June 30, 2010 State substantive plan actuarial valuation, the individual entry age normal cost method
was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 4.50% investment rate of return and an annual health care
cost trend rate of actual increases for 2011 and 9.00% in 2012, initially, reduced to an ultimate rate of 4.50%
after seven years. Both rates included a 3.00% annual inflation assumption. Annual wage inflation is assumed
to be 3.25%. The UAAL is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on an open basis over 30
years.

For  the  trial  courts,  in  the  July  1,  2009  biennial  actuarial  valuations,  the  entry  age  normal  cost  method  was
used.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included  a  3.75%  investment  rate  of  return  for  48  trial  courts.  Three  trial
courts  (Lassen,  Orange,  and  Yolo)  use  a  7.75%  investment  rate  of  return  and  Sonoma  uses  a  5.25%
investment rate of return. The actuarial assumptions included an annual health care cost trend rate of 8.50%,
initially, reduced by 0.50% increments to an ultimate rate of 5.00% after ten years. Annual inflation and payroll
growth  are  assumed  to  be  3.00%  and  3.25%,  respectively. The  UAAL  is  amortized  as  a  level  percentage  of
payroll on an open basis over 30 years for 46 trial courts, on a closed basis over 30 years for three trial courts
(Lassen,  Sonoma,  and Yolo)  and  on  a  closed  basis  over  28  years  for  Orange. Two  trial  courts  (Alpine  and
Mendocino) amortize the UAAL on a closed basis over 28 years as a level dollar amount.

B.  University of California Retiree Health Plan

Plan  Description:    The  University  of  California,  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  administers
single-employer health and welfare plans to provide health and welfare benefits, primarily medical, dental and
vision, to eligible retirees and their families (retirees) of the university and its affiliates. The Regents have the
authority  to  establish  or  amend  the  plans.  Additional  information  can  be  obtained  from  the  2009-10  annual
report of the University of California Health and Welfare Plans.

166

Notes to the Financial Statements

Membership  in  the  University  of  California  Retirement  Plan  is  required  to  become  eligible  for  retiree  health
benefits.  As  of  July  1,  2009,  the  date  of  the  latest  actuarial  valuation,  33,954  retirees  are  receiving  such
benefits.

Funding Policy:  The contribution requirements of the university and eligible retirees are established and may
be  amended  by  the  university.  The  contribution  requirements  are  based  upon  projected  pay-as-you-go
financing. Contributions toward medical and dental benefits are shared between the university and the retiree.
The university does not contribute toward the cost of other benefits available to retirees. Employees who meet
specific  requirements  including  completed  years  of  credited  service  may  continue  their  medical  and  dental
benefits into retirement and continue to receive university contributions for those benefits.  Active employees
do not make any contributions toward the retiree health benefit plans. Retirees pay the excess, if any, of the
premium over the applicable portion of the university’s contribution.

Table 52 presents the university’s OPEB cost, the percentage of annual OPEB cost contributed to the plan,
and the net OPEB obligation for the year ended June 30, 2010, and the two preceding years.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Funded  Status  and  Funding  Progress:  For  the  University  of  California,  as  of  July  1,  2009—the  most  recent
actuarial  valuation  date—the  AAL  for  benefits  was  $15.1  billion,  and  the  actuarial  value  of  assets  was
$77 million,  resulting  in  a  UAAL  of  negative  $15.0  billion.  The  covered  payroll  (annual  payroll  of  active
employees  covered  by  the  plan)  was  $7.9  billion,  and  the  ratio  of  the  UAAL  to  the  covered  payroll  was
negative 191%.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: For the University of California, in the July 1, 2009 actuarial valuation, the
individual entry age normal cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 5.5% investment rate
of  return,  an  annual  health  care  cost  trend  rate  of  10.0%  to  12.0%  initially,  depending  on  the  type  of  plan,
reduced by increments to an ultimate rate of 5.0% over nine years, with a projected 3.0% inflation rate. The
UAAL is being amortized as a flat dollar amount over 30 years on a closed basis.

NOTE 26:  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The following information describes significant events that occurred subsequent to June 30, 2010, but prior to
the date of the auditor’s report.

A. Debt  Issuances

In  November  2010,  the  primary  government  issued  $4.5  billion  in  general  obligation  bonds  to  finance  or
refinance  capital  project  facilities  and  other  voter-approved  costs  for  public  purposes,  including:  correctional
facilities;  neighborhood  parks;  safe  drinking  water;  children’s  hospitals;  public  education 
facilities;
transportation; highway safety, traffic reduction, air quality, and port security; housing and emergency shelters;
watershed  and  flood  protection;  river,  coast,  and  beach  protection;  water  quality,  supply,  and  conservation;
literacy  improvement  and  public  library  construction  and  renovation;  medical  research;  high-speed  rail
facilities; and disaster preparedness and flood prevention.

In October 2010, the Department of Water Resources issued $98 million in water system revenue bonds and
$1.8  billion  in  power  supply  revenue  bonds  to  refund  certain  outstanding  bonds,  retire  outstanding  water
revenue  commercial  paper  notes,  make  interest-rate  swap  termination  payments,  and  pay  the  related
issuance costs.   

Between  July  and  November  2010,  the  California  State  University  (CSU)  authorized  $136  million  in  bond
anticipation notes to finance or refinance construction projects at various campuses. As of November 2010,
CSU had issued only $58 million of the authorized commercial paper.  

Between  July  and  December  2010,  the  Regents  of  the  University  of  California,  a  discretely  presented
component unit, issued $1.8 billion in general revenue bonds, including $1.4 billion of taxable Build America
Bonds, $388 million of tax-exempt bonds, and $60 million of taxable bonds to finance and refinance certain
facilities and projects of the university.

B. Cash Management

The State’s 2010-11 Budget Act was not enacted until October 8, 2010. This prevented the State from making
payments  for  many  programs  which  did  not  have  continuing  appropriations  or  constitutionally  mandated
payment  obligations,  and  payments  to  a  variety  of  suppliers  of  goods  and  services  to  the  State.  Once  the
Budget Act was enacted, the State had to meet all its obligations which had remained unpaid in the absence of
valid appropriations during the three months that the State had no approved budget.  

168

This created cash challenges in the months of October and November 2010. To alleviate the cash shortfall, in
October 2010, the State deferred approximately $4.5 billion in payments as authorized under the March 2010
Cash Management Bill (Assembly Bill 5) and issued $6.7 billion of interim revenue anticipation notes (RANs)
through a private placement. In November 2010, the State issued $10.0 billion of RANs. The proceeds of the
RANs enabled the State to repay the $6.7 billion of interim RANs.

Notes to the Financial Statements

C. Other

In November 2010, voters approved the following initiatives that will have an impact on the State’s budget and
finances: 

(cid:129)

 (cid:129)

(cid:129)

Proposition 22 – Prohibits 
transportation,
redevelopment,  or  local  government  projects  and  services;  and  voids  any  laws  enacted  between
October 20, 2009 and November 2, 2010 that are in conflict with its provisions.

from  borrowing  or 

the  State 

taking 

funds  used 

for 

Proposition 25 – Changes the legislative vote requirement to pass budget and budget-related legislation
from two-thirds to a simple majority; retains two-thirds vote requirement for taxes.

Proposition 26 – Requires that certain state and local fees be approved by two-thirds vote. Fees include
those that address adverse impacts on society or the environment caused by the fee-payer’s business.
Its  provisions  also  void  any  conflicting  state 
laws  adopted  between  January 1, 2010  and
November 2, 2010,  unless  such  laws  are  reenacted  by  the  Legislature  to  be  in  compliance  with  its
provisions within one year after its effective date.

The State Controller’s Office believes neither Proposition 22 nor Proposition 26 has a financial impact on the
financial statements dated June 30, 2010.

California’s  high  demand  for  unemployment  insurance  benefits  required  additional  loans  from  the  U.S.
Department  of  Labor  during  the  2009-10  fiscal  year.  As  of  June  30,  2010,  the  State  had  $7.2  billion  in
outstanding loans from the U.S. Department of Labor that were used to cover deficits in the Unemployment
Programs Fund. As of February 22, 2011, the State had an outstanding loan balance of $10.1 billion and it
expects to request additional loans throughout 2011.

In  August  2010  and  September  2010,  the  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  (CalHFA),  a  discretely
presented  component  unit,  received  an  additional  $476  million  and  $799  million,  respectively,  in  federal
funding for unemployment programs. As of October 28, 2010, the CalHFA had nearly $2 billion for programs
that  assist  struggling  homeowners  throughout  the  State.  On  October  26,  2010  Moody’s  Investor  Services
downgraded CalHFA’s issuer credit rating to A2 from A1 with negative outlook. They based the downgrade on
the  erosion  of  CalHFA’s  fund  balances,  profitability  and  liquidity  as  a  result  of  single  family  mortgage  loan
delinquencies  and  foreclosures,  risks  related  to  CalHFA’s  high  level  exposure  of  variable  rate  debt,  and
uncertainty about future financial growth. 

Effective November 1, 2010, the Education Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) replaced EdFund as the
designated  guaranty  agency  for  the  California  Student  Aid  Commission’s  (Commission)  Federal  Family
Education  Loan  (FFEL)  Program  portfolio.  ECMC  assumed  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Commission’s
guaranty  agency  activities.  As  part  of  this  transition,  the  US  Department  of  Education  agreed  to  provide
$100 million in funding during the 2010-11 fiscal year to support Cal Grant program awards.

Infrastructure Assets Using the Modified Approach

Pursuant  to  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (GASB)  Statement  No.  34,  the  State  uses  the
modified  approach  to  report  the  cost  of  its  infrastructure  assets  (state  roadways  and  bridges).    Under  the
modified  approach,  the  State  does  not  report  depreciation  expense  for  roads  and  bridges  but  capitalizes  all
costs  that  add  to  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  State-owned  roads  and  bridges.    All  maintenance  and
preservation costs are expensed and not capitalized.

A. Infrastructure Asset Reporting Categories

The infrastructure assets reported in the State’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010,
are in the following categories and amounts: state highway infrastructure (completed highway projects) totaling
$60.1  billion,  land  purchased  for  highway  projects  totaling  $11.9  billion,  and  infrastructure  construction-in-
progress (uncompleted highway projects) totaling $5.0 billion.

Donation  and  Relinquishment:  Donation  and  relinquishment  activity  affects  the  inventory  of  statewide  lane
miles,  land,  and/or  bridges  as  adjustments  to  the  infrastructure  assets  and/or  land  balance  in  the  State’s
financial statements. There were no donations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. Relinquishments for
the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  2010,  are  $57  million  of  state  highway  infrastructure  and  $12  million  of
infrastructure land.

B. Condition Baselines and Assessments

1. Bridges

The  State  uses  the  Bridge  Health  Index—a  numerical  rating  scale  from  0  to  100  that  uses  element-level
inspection  data—to  determine  the  aggregate  condition  of  its  bridges.   The  inspection  data  is  based  on  the
American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials’ (AASHTO) “Commonly Recognized Elements
for Bridge Inspection.” 

174

Required Supplementary Information

From  a  deterioration  standpoint,  the  Bridge  Health  Index  (BHI)  represents  the  remaining  asset  value  of  the
bridge.  A new bridge that has 100% of its asset value has a BHI of 100.  As a bridge deteriorates over time, it
loses asset value, as represented by a decline in its BHI.  When a deteriorated bridge is repaired, it will regain
some (or all) of its asset value and its BHI will increase.

The State’s established condition baseline and actual BHI for fiscal years 2007-08 through 2009-10 are shown
in the following table.

2. Roadways

The State conducts a periodic pavement condition survey, which evaluates ride quality and structural integrity
and identifies the number of distressed lane miles. The State classifies its roadways’ pavement condition by the
following descriptions:

1.
2.
3.

Excellent/good condition – minor or no potholes or cracks.
Fair condition – moderate potholes or cracks.
Poor condition – significant or extensive potholes or cracks.

Statewide  lane  miles  are  considered  “distressed  lane  miles”  if  they  are  in  either  fair  or  poor  condition. The
actual distressed lane miles are compared to the established condition baseline to ensure that the baseline is
not exceeded.

C. Budgeted and Actual Preservation Costs

The  estimated  budgeted  preservation  costs  represent  the  preservation  projects  approved  by  the  California
Transportation  Commission  and  the  State’s  scheduled  preservation  work  for  each  fiscal  year.  The  actual
preservation costs represent the cumulative cost to date for the projects approved and work scheduled in each
fiscal year. Prior to the 2008-09 fiscal year, the State excluded the annual expenditures for one of its bridges
from  preservation  costs.  Beginning  in  the  2008-09  fiscal  year,  the  State  included  the  expenditures  for  the
bridge in both budgeted and actual preservation costs and restated the costs for previous years. 

The  State’s  budgeted  and  actual  preservation  cost  information  for  the  most  recent  and  four  previous  fiscal
years is shown in the following table.

Notes to the Required Supplementary Information
Budgetary Comparison Schedule

The  State  annually  reports  its  financial  condition  based  on  a  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles
(GAAP)  basis  and  on  the  State’s  budgetary  provisions  (budgetary  basis).  The  Budgetary  Comparison
Schedule, General Fund and Major Special Revenue Funds reports the original budget, the final budget, the
actual  expenditures,  and  the  variance  between  the  final  budget  and  the  actual  expenditures,  using  the
budgetary basis of accounting.

On  a  budgetary  basis,  individual  appropriations  are  charged  as  expenditures  when  commitments  for  goods
and services are incurred. However, for financial reporting purposes, the State reports expenditures based on
the year in which goods and services are received. The Budgetary Comparison Schedule includes all of the
current-year  expenditures  for  the  General  Fund  and  major  special  revenue  funds  as  well  as  their  related
appropriations  that  are  legislatively  authorized  annually,  continually,  or  by  project.  On  a  budgetary  basis,
adjustments for encumbrances are budgeted under other general government, while the encumbrances relate
to all programs’ expenditures.

The Budgetary Comparison Schedule is not presented in this document at the legal level of budgetary control
because such a presentation would be extremely lengthy and cumbersome. The State of California prepares a
separate  report,  the  Comprehensive  Annual  Financial  Report  Supplement,  which  includes  statements  that
demonstrate  compliance  with  the  legal  level  of  budgetary  control  in  accordance  with  GASB’s  Codification  of
Governmental  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  Section  2400.121.  This  report  includes  the
comparison  of  the  annual  appropriated  budget  with  expenditures  at  the  legal  level  of  control.  A  copy  of  the
Comprehensive  Annual  Financial  Report  Supplement  is  available  upon  request  from  the  State  Controller’s
Office, Division of Accounting and Reporting, P.O. Box 942850, Sacramento, California 94250-5872.

Required Supplementary Information

Reconciliaton of Budgetary Basis With GAAP Basis

The reconciliation of Budgetary Basis fund balances of the General Fund and the major special revenue funds
to  GAAP  Basis  fund  balances  are  presented  on  the  previous  page  and  are  explained  in  the  following
paragraphs. 

The beginning fund balances for the General Fund, Federal Fund, and Transportation Fund on the budgetary
basis  are  restated  for  prior-year  revenue  adjustments  and  prior-year  expenditure  adjustments.  A  prior-year
revenue  adjustment  occurs  when  the  actual  amount  received  in  the  current  year  differs  from  the  amount  of
revenue accrued in the prior year. A prior-year expenditure adjustment results when the actual amount paid in
the  current  year  differs  from  the  prior-year  accrual  for  appropriations  whose  ability  to  encumber  funds  has
lapsed in previous periods. The beginning fund balance on a GAAP basis is not affected by these adjustments.

Basis Difference

Interfund Receivables and Loans Receivable: Loans made to other funds or to other governments are normally
recorded  as  expenditures  on  the  budgetary  basis.  However,  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  these  loans  are
recorded  as  assets. The  adjustments  related  to  interfund  receivables  caused  a  $150  million  increase  to  the
fund balance in the General Fund and a $1.9 billion increase to the fund balance in the Transportation Fund.
The  adjustments  related  to  loans  receivable  caused  increases  of  $108 million  in  the  General  Fund  and
$96 million in the Federal Fund.

Interfund  Payables:  Loans  received  from  other  funds  or  from  other  governments  are  normally  recorded  as
revenues on a budgetary basis. However, in accordance with GAAP, these loans are recorded as liabilities. The
adjustments related to interfund payables caused a $3.1 billion decrease to the budgetary fund balance in the
General Fund.

Escheat Property: A liability for the estimated amount of escheat property expected to ultimately be reclaimed
and paid is not reported on a budgetary basis. The liability is required to be reported on a GAAP basis. This
adjustment caused a $961 million decrease to the General Fund balance.

Bonds Authorized but Unissued: In the year that general obligation bonds are authorized by the voters, the full
amount authorized is recognized as revenue on a budgetary basis. In accordance with GAAP, only the amount
of  bonds  issued  each  year  is  reported  as  an  other  financing  source.  The  adjustments  related  to  bonds
authorized but unissued caused a $22.7 billion decrease to the fund balance in the Transportation Fund.

Tax Revenues:  Estimated tax payments are accrued on a budgetary basis pursuant to Chapter 751, Statutes
of 2008. However, in accordance with GAAP, tax payments are accrued based on the portion of estimated net
final payments related to the fiscal year.  This adjustment caused a fund balance increase of $814 million in the
General Fund.

Other:  Certain  other  adjustments  and  reclassifications  are  necessary  in  order  to  present  the  financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. The other adjustments caused a fund balance increase of $2 million in
the General Fund and a fund balance decrease of $217 million in the Transportation Fund.

Timing Difference

Liabilities  Budgeted  in  Subsequent Years:  On  a  budgetary  basis,  the  primary  government  does  not  accrue
liabilities for which there is no existing appropriation or no currently available appropriation. The adjustments
made to account for these liabilities in accordance with GAAP caused fund balance decreases of $12.1 billion
in the General Fund, $16 million in the Federal Fund, and $150 million in the Transportation Fund.  The large
decrease in the General Fund primarily consists of $5.7 billion for deferred apportionment payments to K-12
schools  and  community  colleges,  $2.7  billion  in  tax  overpayments,  $1.2  billion  for  medical  assistance,
$800 million for June 2010 payroll that was deferred to July 2010, and $395 million for pension contributions.

* On  a  budgetary  basis,  the  State’s  funds  are  classified  as  either  governmental  cost  funds  or  nongovernmental  cost  funds.  The
governmental cost funds include the General Fund, most of the funds that comprise the Transportation Fund, and many other funds
that make up the nonmajor governmental funds reported in these financial statements. Governmental cost funds derive their revenue
from  taxes,  licenses,  and  fees  that  support  the  general  operations  of  the  State.  The  appropriations  of  the  budgetary  basis
governmental cost funds form the annual appropriated budget of the State. Nongovernmental cost funds consist of funds that derive
their  receipts  from  sources  other  than  general  and  special  taxes,  licenses,  fees,  or  state  revenues  and  mainly  represent  the
proprietary  and  fiduciary  funds  reported  in  these  financial  statements.  Expenditures  of  these  funds  do  not  represent  a  cost  of
government  and  most  of  the  nongovernmental  cost  funds  are  not  included  in  the  annual  appropriated  budget.  Therefore,  the
expenditures of these funds are not included in this schedule. The Federal Fund is one nongovernmental cost fund that is included in
the annual appropriated budget. The Budgetary Comparison Schedule for the General Fund, Federal Fund, and Transportation Fund
is included in the Required Supplementary Information section; the remaining governmental cost funds are reflected in this schedule.
Additional  information  on  the  budgetary  basis  of  accounting  can  be  found  in  the  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  Note    2,
Budgetary  and  Legal  Compliance,  notes  to  the  Required  Supplementary  Information,  and  the  Comprehensive  Annual  Financial
Report Supplement.

Nonmajor Enterprise Funds

Enterprise funds account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private
business  enterprises,  where  the  costs  of  providing  goods  or  services  to  the  general  public  on  a
continuing basis are intended to be financed or recovered primarily through user charges. Following are
brief descriptions of nonmajor enterprise funds.

The High Technology Education Fund accounts for construction and renovation of public buildings
for educational and research purposes related to specific fields of high technology.

The  State  University  Dormitory  Building  Maintenance  and  Equipment  Fund  accounts  for
charges  to  students  for  housing  and  parking,  for  student  fees  for  campus  unions,  and  for  revenue
bond proceeds for constructing or acquiring dormitories and other facilities.

The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund accounts for loans to finance the construction
of publicly owned water pollution control facilities.

The Housing Loan Fund  accounts  for  financing  and  contracts  for  the  sale  of  properties  to  eligible
California veterans.

Other  enterprise  program  funds  account  for  all  other  goods  or  services  provided  to  the  general
public on a continuing basis when all or most of the cost involved is to be financed by user charges,
or  when  periodic  measurement  of  the  results  of  operations  is  appropriate  for  management  control,
accountability, capital maintenance, public policy, or other purposes.

Note:

The State did not begin reporting government-wide statements until it implemented GASB Statement No. 34 in fiscal year 2002.

In fiscal year 2004, all infrastructure assets were included in the financial statements for the first time.

1 
2  Unrestricted  net  assets  reflect  a  negative  balance  because  of  outstanding  bonded  debt  issued  to  build  capital  assets  for  school
districts and other local governmental entities. In fiscal year 2003, unrestricted net assets decreased primarily as a result of lower-
than-expected general revenues caused by the near-stagnant economy and the State’s continued structural budget deficits.

Due to BOE’s conversion from business coding to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) coding for the reporting of
Taxable  Sales  by  Industry,  industry  level  data  for  2009  is  not  comparable  to  that  reported  for  prior  years.  The  NAICS  conversion
process for over one million permit holders was not completed until the end of 2008, so 2009 was the first year BOE used the new
format with NAICS codes.  
The direct sales tax rate used is the state tax rate that provides revenue to the State’s General Fund and debt service fund. It does not
include the 1% local tax rate that is allocated to cities and counties.
3 
Rate change was effective on July 1, 2004.
4  Rate change was effective on April 1, 2009.

Due to BOE’s conversion from business coding to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) coding for the reporting of
Taxable  Sales  by  Industry,  industry  level  data  for  2009  is  not  comparable  to  that  reported  for  prior  years.  The  NAICS  conversion
process for over one million permit holders was not completed until the end of 2008, so 2009 was the first year BOE used the new
format with NAICS codes.  
As of July 1.

3  Calculated by multiplying the taxable sales by industry shown on pages 266 and 267 by the direct sales tax rate. Amounts in thousands.
