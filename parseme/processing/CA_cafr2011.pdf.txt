California State Controller

March 23, 2012

To the Citizens, Governor, and Members
of the Legislature of the State of California:

I am pleased to submit the State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. This report meets the requirements of Government Code section 12460
for an annual report prepared strictly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  and  contains  information  to  help  readers  gain  a  reasonable
understanding of the State’s financial activities. 

California’s economic recovery continued throughout the last fiscal year, but at a slow pace. Although the
State’s  “bottom-line”  (primary  government  net  assets)  does  not  reflect  it,  there  is  some  evidence  that
California’s downward trend has stopped and its financial position is improving. For the fiscal year ended
June  30,  2011,  the  State’s  expenses  exceeded  revenues  by  $3.5  billion  for  governmental  activities,  a
$7.7  billion  improvement  from  last  year’s  $11.2  billion  shortfall.  Governmental  activities  include  most
services and expenses normally associated with state government, such as health and human services,
education, business and transportation, correctional programs, and general government.

The State’s three major sources of revenue—personal income taxes, corporation taxes, and sales and
use taxes—increased in total by 8.6%, from $87.1 billion in the 2009-10 fiscal year to $94.6 billion in the
2010-11 fiscal year. The significant factor was an increase of $7.9 billion in personal income taxes, while
corporate and sales and use taxes remained almost static.

Recent  indicators  show  that  California’s  fiscal  outlook  is  not  improving  as  quickly  as  was  forecast.
Specifically,  as  of  February  2012,  the  State’s  year-to-date  cash  receipts  from  its  three  largest  revenue
sources was approximately $830 million less than estimated and $6 billion less than the amount received
by the end of February 2011. However, while California’s unemployment rate was 12.4% in July 2010, it
had dropped to 11.8% by June of 2011. In addition, State personal income showed consistent increases
in each quarter of fiscal year 2010-11, increasing 5.5% over the course of the fiscal year. 

Although California’s economy is showing modest signs of recovery, the State still faces budgetary and
cash shortfalls in the current and following fiscal years. In the short term, the State needs budget tactics
that  continue  to  focus  on  multiyear  results  and  ongoing  solutions.  The  State  must  develop  consistent
funding  strategies  that  will  reduce  its  long-term  obligations  such  as  those  for  infrastructure,  retirement,
and  budgetary  borrowing.  A  focus  on  achieving  long-term  fiscal  stability  must  be  maintained  to  ensure
sound financial results.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Introduction to the Report

Responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness,  and  fairness  of  data  presented  in  the  CAFR,  including  all
disclosures, rests with the State. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the enclosed data are accurate in all
material respects and are reported in a manner that fairly presents the financial position and the operations of
the primary government and its component units.

State statutes require an annual audit of the basic financial statements of the State. To meet this requirement,
the State Auditor has examined the accompanying financial statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  and  Government  Auditing  Standards  issued  by  the
Comptroller  General  of  the  United  States.  The  auditor’s  report  on  the  basic  financial  statements  and  the
combining and individual fund statements and schedules is included in the CAFR.

The State of California is also required to undergo an annual single audit in conformity with the provisions of
the  United  States  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s  (OMB)  Circular  A-133,  Audits  of  States,  Local
Governments,  and  Non-Profit  Organizations.  In  conducting  the  engagement,  the  State  Auditor  used  auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards issued by
the Comptroller General of the United States. Information related to this single audit—including a schedule of
federal assistance, the independent auditor’s report on compliance with requirements applicable to each major
program and on internal controls over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, and a schedule of
findings and questioned costs—is included in a separately issued report.

The CAFR contains three sections: Introductory, Financial, and Statistical. The Introductory Section is designed
to provide the background and context that readers need to benefit fully from the information presented in the
Financial Section. The Financial Section contains the independent auditor’s report, management’s discussion
and  analysis,  the  basic  financial  statements,  the  required  supplementary  information,  the  combining  and
individual  fund  statements,  and  the  budgetary  comparison  schedule  for  nonmajor  governmental  cost  funds.
The Statistical Section provides a history of selected financial and demographic information.

The  State’s  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (MD&A)  immediately  follows  the  independent  auditor’s
report and contains an introduction, overview, and analysis of the financial statements. Our MD&A provides a
narrative introduction to the detailed financial statements and notes contained in the CAFR.

Profile of the Government

Reporting Entity 

The  financial  reporting  entity  of  the  State  includes  all  of  the  funds  of  the  primary  government  and  of  its
component units. Component units are legally separate entities for which the primary government is financially
accountable.  Blended  component  units,  although  legally  separate  entities,  are,  in  substance,  part  of  the
primary government’s operations and are included as part of the primary government. Accordingly, the building
authorities  are  reported  in  the  capital  projects  funds  of  the  primary  government.  The  lease  agreements
between the building authorities and the primary government, amounting to $501 million, have been eliminated
from  the  balance  sheet.  Instead,  only  the  underlying  capital  assets  and  the  debt  used  to  acquire  them  are
reported in the government-wide statements. The Golden State Tobacco Securitization Corporation is reported
as a special revenue fund of the primary government. 

iv

California State Controller’s Transmittal Letter

Discretely presented component units are reported separately in the government-wide financial statements to
emphasize  that  they  are  legally  separate  from  the  primary  government  and  to  differentiate  their  financial
position  and  results  of  operations  from  those  of  the  primary  government.  Additional  information  on  the
reporting entity is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Budgetary Controls

The State Legislature prepares an annual budget that contains estimates of revenues and expenditures for the
ensuing  fiscal  year.  This  budget  is  the  result  of  negotiations  between  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature.
Throughout  the  fiscal  year,  adjustments  in  the  form  of  budget  revisions,  executive  orders,  and  financial
legislation  agreed  to  by  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature  are  made  to  the  budget.  The  State  Controller  is
statutorily  responsible  for  control  over  revenues  due  the  primary  government  and  for  expenditures  of  each
appropriation contained in the budget. Budgeted appropriations are the expenditure authorizations that allow
state agencies to purchase or create liabilities for goods and services. 

The State’s accounting system provides the State Controller’s Office with a centrally-controlled record system
to fully account for each budgeted appropriation, including its unexpended balance, and for all cash receipts
and  disbursements. The  accounting  system  is  decentralized,  meaning  the  detail  of  each  control  account  is
maintained  by  each  state  agency.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  control  accounts  and  the  agency  accounts  are
maintained and reconciled on a cash basis. At the end of the fiscal year, each agency prepares annual accrual
reports for receivables and payables. The State Controller’s Office combines its control account balances with
the agency accrual reports to prepare California’s Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report and the Budgetary/
Legal Basis Annual Report Supplement. State laws and regulations that, in some cases, do not fully agree with
GAAP govern the methods of accounting for expenditures and revenues in these reports. 

The information in the CAFR represents a consolidation of the amounts in the Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual
Report and adjustments to the account balances to conform to GAAP. Additional information on the budgetary
basis  of  accounting  can  be  found  in  Note  2,  Budgetary  and  Legal  Compliance,  and  in  the  Required
Supplementary Information section that follows the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Internal Controls

An internal control structure has been designed to ensure that the assets of the government are protected from
loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  legal  requirements  and  GAAP.  The  internal  control  structure  is
designed  to  provide  reasonable,  but  not  absolute,  assurance  that  these  objectives  are  met. The  concept  of
reasonable  assurance  recognizes  that:  (1)  the  cost  of  a  control  should  not  exceed  the  benefits  likely  to  be
derived,  and  (2)  the  valuation  of  costs  and  benefits  requires  estimates  and  judgments  by  management.  In
addition, the government maintains extensive budgetary controls. The objective of these controls is to ensure
compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by the Legislature and
Governor.

Financial Condition

Economic Outlook

California’s economy has continued to improve during the first half of fiscal year 2011-12. Since hitting bottom
at the end of the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2010-11, the State has added back 351,100 of the non-farm
jobs lost during the downturn. Personal income in California, which stood at $1.67 trillion in the third quarter of
2011,  has  already  surpassed  its  pre-recession  peak  after  almost  two  years  of  consecutive  growth  on  a
quarterly basis. In addition to growing consumer demand from domestic sources, international trade also has
been  playing  a  large  role  in  speeding  up  California’s  recovery.  California’s  exports,  including  industrial
machinery, vehicles and parts, aircrafts, pharmaceuticals, and plastics, are booming. While home prices have
yet  to  rebound  across  the  State,  the  housing  market  has  stabilized  and  is  beginning  to  move  in  the  right
direction.  New  single-family  building  permits  were  still  declining 
first  six  months  of
fiscal year 2011-12,  but  multi-family  building  permits  have  been  trending  upward  since  mid-2010  and
nonresidential permit values have steadily increased through 2011.

the 

Budget Outlook

2011-12 Fiscal Year

California’s 2011-12 Budget Act was enacted on June 30, 2011. The Budget enacted $27.2 billion in actions to
solve  a  General  Fund  gap  between  resources  and  expenditures.  However,  revised  estimates  show  that
significantly less revenue is expected from the federal government and other sources, and that the State will
not  be  able  to  achieve  all  of  its  other  planned  budget  solutions. The  proposed  2012-13  Governor’s  Budget
projects that the General Fund will end fiscal year 2011-12 with a deficit of $4.1 billion. 

2012-13 Fiscal Year

The Governor released his proposed 2012-13 Budget on January 5, 2012. This proposed Budget projects a
$9.2 billion gap between estimated revenues and state expenditures over the next 18 months. The Governor’s
Budget  proposes  $4.2  billion  in  expenditure-related  solutions,  $4.7  billion  in  new  revenues,  and  $1.4  billion
borrowed  from  special  funds  and  other  sources.  The  2012-13  Governor’s  Budget  (with  all  budget  solutions
enacted)  projects  General  Fund  revenues  and  transfers  of  $95.4  billion  and  expenditures  of  $92.6  billion,
resulting in a $1.1 billion reserve. A significant element included in the Governor’s plan is a proposed initiative
to  be  placed  on  the  November  2012  general  election  ballot.  If  approved  by  the  voters,  this  measure  will
temporarily increase the personal income tax on annual earnings of more than $250,000 for seven years and
temporarily increase the sales tax by one-quarter percent for four years, generating an estimated $6.8 billion to
$9  billion  for  2012-13,  and  $5.4  billion  to  $7.6  billion,  on  average,  in  the  following  five  fiscal  years.
Expenditure-related  solutions  include  reductions  of  $1.4  billion  for  CalWorks  and  $1  billion  in  combined
reductions to Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services.

Awards and Acknowledgments

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate
of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the State of California for its comprehensive annual
financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a
government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report.
This  report  must  satisfy  both  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  applicable  legal  requirements.  A
Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only.  

This  CAFR  could  not  have  been  prepared  without  the  assistance  and  cooperation  of  all  state  agencies  and
universities.  We  wish  to  thank  the  State  Auditor  and  her  staff  for  their  audit  of  the  financial  statements
contained  in  this  report.  I  am  also  grateful  to  the  members  of  my  staff  for  their  dedicated  efforts  and
professionalism.

Sincerely,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

The  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  a  required  supplement  to  the  State  of  California’s
financial statements. It describes and analyzes the financial position of the State, providing an overview of the
State’s  activities  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2011.  We  encourage  readers  to  consider  the  information  we
present here in conjunction with the information presented in the Controller’s letter of transmittal at the front of
this report and in the State’s financial statements and notes, which follow this section.

Financial Highlights – Primary Government

Government-wide Highlights

During  the  2010-11  fiscal  year,  California  showed  signs  of  fiscal  recovery,  but  it  continued  to  struggle
financially as a result of the recent recession. The State’s general revenues increased by $10.1 billion (10.7%)
from  last  year;  however,  revenues  were  $5.1 billion  lower  than  those  received  in  the  2007-08  fiscal  year.
Expenses for the State’s governmental activities increased slightly from the prior year, but exceeded revenue
received  resulting  in  a  $3.5 billion  decrease  in  governmental  activities’  net  assets.  Total  expenses  for  the
State’s  business-type  activities  exceeded  revenues  for  fiscal  year  2010-11.  In  fiscal  year  2010-11,  the
California  State  University  financial  activities  were  reclassified  from  governmental  activities  to  enterprise
activities. Reduced general revenues, expenses that exceeded revenues, and increased long-term obligations
resulted  in  a  50% decrease  in  the  total  net  assets  for  governmental  and  business-type  activities  from  the
2009-10 fiscal year.

Net Assets — The primary government’s net assets as of June 30, 2011, were a negative $9.7 billion. After the
total  net  assets  are  reduced  by  $86.8 billion  for  investment  in  capital  assets  (net  of  related  debt)  and  by
$31.5 billion  for  restricted  net  assets,  the  resulting  unrestricted  net  assets  totaled  a  negative  $128.0  billion.
Restricted net assets are dedicated for specified uses and are not available to fund current activities. Almost
one-half  of  the  negative  $128.0  billion  consists  of  $62.6  billion  in  outstanding  bonded  debt  issued  to  build
capital  assets  for  school  districts  and  other  local  governmental  entities.  The  bonded  debt  reduces  the
unrestricted net assets; however, local governments, not the State, record the capital assets that would offset
this reduction.

Changes in Net Assets — The primary government’s total net assets decreased by $3.2 billion (50.0%) during
the year ended June 30, 2011. Net assets of governmental activities decreased by $3.5 billion (51.3%), while
net assets of business-type activities increased by $330 million (69.3%).

Fund Highlights

Governmental Funds — GASB Statement No. 54 provides new fund balance classifications for governmental
funds. The previous reserved and unreserved classifications have been replaced with nonspendable, restricted,
and unrestricted balances. Additional information on the State’s fund balances can be found in Note 1K in the
notes  to  the  basic  financial  statements.  As  of  June  30,  2011,  the  primary  government’s  governmental  funds
reported a combined ending fund balance of $10.8 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion from the prior fiscal year’s
restated  ending  fund  balance.  The  unrestricted  fund  balance,  comprised  of  committed,  assigned,  and
unassigned  balances,  was  negative  $17.3  billion.  The  nonspendable  and  restricted  fund  balances  were
$187 million and $27.9 billion, respectively.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Proprietary  Funds  —  As  of  June  30,  2011,  the  primary  government’s  proprietary  funds  reported  combined
ending net assets of $1.4 billion, an increase of $375 million from the prior fiscal year. After the total net assets
are  reduced  by  $1.5  billion  for  investment  in  capital  assets  (net  of  related  debt),  expendable  restrictions  of
$3.6 billion,  and  nonexpendable  restrictions  of  $22  million,  the  unrestricted  net  assets  totaled  a  negative
$3.8 billion.

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities

As of June 30, 2011, the primary government’s noncurrent assets totaled $134.8 billion, of which $109.0 billion
is related to capital assets. State highway infrastructure assets of $61.4 billion represent the largest portion of
the State’s capital assets.

The primary government’s noncurrent liabilities totaled $158.1 billion, which consists of $78.3 billion in general
obligation bonds, $29.4 billion in revenue bonds, and $50.3 billion in all other noncurrent liabilities. During the
2010-11 fiscal year, the primary government’s noncurrent liabilities increased by $8.7 billion (5.8%) over the
prior  fiscal  year.  This  increase  was  primarily  the  result  of  a  $3.8  billion  increase  in  the  unemployment
programs’  loan  payable  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  and  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  net  other
postemployment benefits obligations.

Overview of the Financial Statements

This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the section presenting the State’s basic financial statements,
which  includes  four  components:  (1) government-wide  financial  statements,  (2)  fund  financial  statements,
(3) discretely presented component units financial statements, and (4) notes to the financial statements. This
report also contains required supplementary information and combining financial statements and schedules.

Government-wide Financial Statements

Government-wide  financial  statements  are  designed  to  provide  readers  with  a  broad  overview  of  the  State’s
finances.  The  government-wide  financial  statements  do  not  include  fiduciary  programs  and  activities  of  the
primary  government  and  component  units  because  fiduciary  resources  are  not  available  to  support  state
programs.

To help readers assess the State’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year, the statements provide
both short-term and long-term information about the State’s financial position. These statements are prepared
using  the  economic  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  similar  to  methods
used by most businesses. These statements take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the
fiscal year, regardless of when the State received or paid the cash. The government-wide financial statements
include two statements: the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities.

The  Statement  of  Net  Assets  presents  all  of  the  State’s  assets  and  liabilities  and  reports  the  difference
between  the  two  as  net  assets.  Over  time,  increases  or  decreases  in  net  assets  indicate  whether  the
financial position of the State is improving or deteriorating.

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State’s net assets changed during the
most recent fiscal year. The State reports changes in net assets as soon as the event giving rise to the
change occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, this statement reports revenues
and expenses for some items that will result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes

and  earned  but  unused  vacation  leave).  This  statement  also  presents  a  comparison  between  direct
expenses and program revenues for each function of the State.

The government-wide financial statements separate into different columns the three types of state programs
and activities: governmental activities, business-type activities, and component units.

(cid:129)

•

(cid:129)

Governmental activities are mostly supported by taxes, such as personal income and sales and use taxes,
and  intergovernmental  revenues,  primarily  federal  grants.  Most  services  and  expenses  normally
associated  with  state  government  fall  into  this  activity  category,  including  health  and  human  services,
education  (public  kindergarten  through  12th  grade  [K-12]  schools  and  institutions  of  higher  education),
business and transportation, correctional programs, general government, resources, state and consumer
services, and interest on long-term debt.

Business-type  activities  typically  recover  all  or  a  significant  portion  of  their  costs  through  user  fees  and
charges  to  external  users  of  goods  and  services.  The  business-type  activities  of  the  State  of  California
include  providing  unemployment  insurance  programs,  providing  housing  loans  to  California  veterans,
providing  water  to  local  water  districts,  providing  building  aid  to  school  districts,  providing  services  to
California  State  University  students,  leasing  public  assets,  selling  California  State  Lottery  tickets,  and
selling  electric  power.  These  activities  are  carried  out  with  minimal  financial  assistance  from  the
governmental activities or general revenues of the State.

Component  units  are  organizations  that  are  legally  separate  from  the  State,  but  are  at  the  same  time
related  to  the  State  financially  (i.e.,  the  State  is  financially  accountable  for  them)  or  the  nature  of  their
relationship with the State is so significant that their exclusion would cause the State’s financial statements
to  be  misleading  or  incomplete.  The  State’s  financial  statements  include  the  information  for  blended,
fiduciary, and discretely presented component units.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Blended component units, although legally separate entities, are in substance a part of the primary
government’s  operations.  Therefore,  for  reporting  purposes,  the  State  integrates  data  from  blended
component  units  into  the  appropriate  funds.  The  Golden  State  Tobacco  Securitization  Corporation
and  certain  building  authorities  that  are  blended  component  units  of  the  State  are  included  in  the
governmental activities. 

Fiduciary component units are legally separate from the primary government but, due to their fiduciary
nature, are included with the primary government’s fiduciary funds. The Public Employees’ Retirement
System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System are fiduciary component units that are included
with  the  State’s  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  trust  funds,  which  are  not  included  in  the
government-wide financial statements.

Discretely presented component units are legally separate from the primary government and provide
services  to  entities  and  individuals  outside  the  primary  government.  The  activities  of  discretely
presented  component  units  are  presented  in  a  single  column  in  the  government-wide  financial
statements.

Information on how to obtain financial statements of the individual component units is available from the State
Controller’s  Office,  Division  of  Accounting  and  Reporting,  P.O.  Box  942850,  Sacramento,  California  94250-
5872.

Fund Financial Statements

Fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar
component units, and discretely presented component units. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is
used  to  maintain  control  over  resources  that  have  been  segregated  for  specific  activities  or  objectives.  The
State of California, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate
compliance with finance-related legal and contractual requirements. Following are general descriptions of the
three types of funds.

(cid:129)

in 

the  government-wide 

Governmental  funds  are  used  to  account  for  essentially  the  same  functions  that  are  reported  as
governmental  activities 
the
government-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on short-term inflows
and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end
of  the  fiscal  year.  Such  information  may  be  useful  in  evaluating  a  government’s  short-term  financing
requirements. This approach is known as the flow of current financial resources measurement focus and
the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  These  governmental  fund  statements  provide  a  detailed
short-term  view  of  the  State’s  finances,  enabling  readers  to  determine  whether  adequate  financial
resources exist to meet the State’s current needs.

financial  statements.  However,  unlike 

Because  governmental  fund  financial  statements  provide  a  narrower  focus  than  do  government-wide
financial statements, it is useful to compare governmental fund statements to the governmental activities
information  presented  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.  By  doing  so,  readers  may  better
understand  the  long-term  impact  of  the  government’s  short-term  financing  decisions.  Reconciliations
located  on  the  pages  immediately  following  the  fund  statements  show  the  differences  between  the
government-wide  statements  and  the  governmental  fund  Balance  Sheet  and  the  governmental  fund
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances. Primary differences between the
government-wide  and  fund  statements  relate  to  noncurrent  assets,  such  as  land  and  buildings,  and
noncurrent  liabilities,  such  as  bonded  debt  and  amounts  owed  for  compensated  absences  and  capital
lease  obligations,  which  are  reported  in  the  government-wide  statements  but  not  in  the  fund-based
statements.

(cid:129)

Proprietary  funds  show  activities  that  operate  more  like  those  found  in  the  private  sector.  The  State  of
California has two proprietary fund types: enterprise funds and internal service funds.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Enterprise funds record activities for which a fee is charged to external users; they are presented as
business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements.

Internal service funds accumulate and allocate costs internally among the State of California’s various
functions.  For  example,  internal  service  funds  provide  information  technology,  printing,  fleet
management, and architectural services primarily for state departments. As a result, their activity is
considered governmental.

Fiduciary funds account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the State. Fiduciary funds and
the  activities  of  fiduciary  component  units  are  not  reflected  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements
because  the  resources  of  these  funds  are  not  available  to  support  State  of  California  programs.  The
accounting  used  for  fiduciary  funds  and  similar  component  units  is  similar  to  that  used  for  proprietary
funds.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Discretely Presented Component Units Financial Statements

As discussed previously, the State has financial accountability for discretely presented component units, which
have certain independent qualities and operate in a similar manner as private-sector businesses. The activities
of the discretely presented component units are classified as enterprise activities. 

Notes to the Financial Statements

The notes to the financial statements in this publication provide additional information that is essential for a full
understanding  of  the  data  provided  in  the  government-wide  and  fund  financial  statements.  The  notes  to  the
financial statements, which describe particular accounts in more detail, are located immediately following the
discretely presented component units’ financial statements.

Required Supplementary Information

A  section  of  required  supplementary  information  follows  the  notes  to  the  basic  financial  statements  in  this
publication.  This  section 
for  certain  pension  and  other
postemployment  benefit  trust  funds,  information  on  infrastructure  assets  based  on  the  modified  approach,  a
budgetary  comparison  schedule,  and  a  reconciliation  of  the  budgetary  basis  and  the  GAAP  basis  fund
balances for the major governmental funds presented in the governmental fund financial statements.

includes  a  schedule  of

Combining Financial Statements and Schedules

The Combining Financial Statements and Schedules – Nonmajor and Other Funds section presents combining
statements that provide separate financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor proprietary
funds, fiduciary funds, and nonmajor component units. The basic financial statements present only summary
information for these activities.

Government-wide Financial Analysis

Net Assets

The  primary  government’s  combined  net  assets  (governmental  and  business-type  activities)  decreased  by
50.0%, from a negative $6.4 billion as restated at June 30, 2010, to a negative $9.7 billion a year later.

The primary government’s $86.8 billion investment in capital assets, such as land, buildings, equipment, and
infrastructure (roads, bridges, and other immovable assets) comprise a significant portion of its net assets. This
amount of capital assets is net of any outstanding debt used to acquire those assets. The State uses capital
assets when providing services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.
Although the State’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, the resources needed to repay
this debt must come from other sources because the State cannot use the capital assets themselves to pay off
the liabilities.

Another $31.5 billion of the primary government’s net assets represents resources that are externally restricted
as  to  how  they  may  be  used,  such  as  resources  pledged  to  debt  service.  Internally  imposed  earmarking  of
resources  is  not  presented  in  this  publication  as  restricted  net  assets.  As  of  June  30,  2011,  governmental
activities  showed  an  unrestricted  net  assets  deficit  of  $124.0 billion  and  business-type  activities  showed  an
unrestricted net assets deficit of $4.2 billion.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

A  large  portion  of  the  negative  unrestricted  net  assets  of  governmental  activities  consists  of  $62.6 billion  in
outstanding  bonded  debt  issued  to  build  capital  assets  for  school  districts  and  other  local  governmental
entities. Because the State does not own these capital assets, neither the assets nor the related bonded debt
is included in the portion of net assets reported as “investment in capital assets, net of related debt.” Instead,
the bonded debt is reported as a non-current liability that reduces the State’s unrestricted net assets. Readers
can expect to see a continued deficit in unrestricted net assets of governmental activities as long as the State
has significant outstanding obligations for school districts and other local governmental entities.

Table  1  presents  condensed  financial  information  derived  from  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  for  the  primary
government.

Changes in Net Assets

The  expenses  of  the  primary  government  totaled  $234.6 billion  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2011.  Of  this
amount, $126.4 billion (53.9%) was funded with program revenues (charges for services or program-specific
grants  and  contributions),  leaving  $108.2 billion  to  be  funded  with  general  revenues  (mainly  taxes).  The
primary government’s general revenues of $105.0 billion were less than the unfunded expenses. As a result,
the total net assets decreased by $3.2 billion, or 50%.

Of  the  total  decrease,  net  assets  for  governmental  activities  decreased  by  $3.5 billion,  while  those  for
business-type activities increased by $330 million.

Expenses

 
For the year ended June 30, 2011, total state tax revenues collected for governmental activities increased by
$10.1 billion (10.7%) from the prior year. Personal income taxes increased by $7.9 billion (17.9%) as a result of
higher personal income reported. The other taxes category increased by $2.5 billion. This $2.5 billion increase
was primarily the result of Assembly Bill X8-6, also known as the Fuel Tax Swap, which redirected a portion of
gasoline taxes from sales taxes to other taxes. Sales and use taxes would have reflected this increase if these
taxes had not been redirected.  

Overall expenses for governmental activities increased by $4.9 billion (2.6%) from the prior year. The largest
increase in expenses was an $11.7 billion increase in health and human services spending primarily due to the
creation  of  the  Hospital  Quality  Assurance  Revenue  Fund,  which  was  established  by  Assembly  Bill  1383
effective October 2009. This increase in expenses was somewhat offset by a $5.3 billion decrease in education
expenditures  reported  as  a  result  of  the  reclassification  of  the  California  State  University  financial  activities
from a governmental fund to an enterprise fund.

Business-type activities expenses totaled $39.0 billion. Program revenues of $36.1 billion, primarily generated
from charges for services, and $3.3 billion in transfers were sufficient to cover these expenses. Consequently,
business-type  activities’  total  net  assets  increased  by  $330 million,  or  69.3%,  during  the  year  ended
June 30, 2011.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Fund Financial Analysis

The national recession and the State’s weakened economy had the greatest impact on governmental funds,
which rely heavily on taxes to support the majority of their services and programs. The State’s governmental
funds  had  a  $1.0 billion  decrease  in  fund  balance  over  the  prior  year’s  restated  ending  fund  balance.  Some
proprietary  funds  incurred  net  asset  reductions,  as  their  expenses  exceeded  revenues  for  the  fiscal  year
2010-11. The Unemployment Programs Fund incurred the largest decline in net assets, $324 million, despite a
$13.4 billion increase in operating revenues due to a draw of federal unemployment funds. More federal funds
were  drawn  to  compensate  for  the  decreased  in  funding  from  the  federal  American  Reinvestment  and
Recovery Act (ARRA).

Governmental Funds

The  governmental  funds’  Balance  Sheet  reported  $60.7 billion  in  assets,  $49.9 billion  in  liabilities,  and
$10.8 billion  in  fund  balance  as  of  June  30,  2011.  Total  assets  of  governmental  funds  decreased  by  12.0%,
while total liabilities decreased by 9.6%, resulting in a total fund balance decrease of $1.0 billion (8.7%) over
the prior fiscal year. As in the prior year, the General Fund had to rely heavily on internal borrowing from the
State’s  other  funds  to  meet  its  payment  obligations.  However,  by  June  30,  2011,  long-term  borrowing  had
decreased by $1.3 billion to $8.9 billion.

Within  the  governmental  funds’  total  fund  balance,  $187 million  is  classified  as  nonspendable  because  this
amount  consists  of  long-term  interfund  receivables  and  loans  receivable,  or  due  to  legal  or  contractual
requirements. Additionally, $27.9 billion is classified as restricted for specific programs by external constraints
such  as  debt  covenants  and  contractual  obligations,  or  by  constitutional  provisions  or  enabling  legislation.
Furthermore,  the  total  fund  balance  of  $2.7 billion  is  classified  as  committed  for  specific  purposes  and
$269 million is classified as assigned for specific purposes. The unassigned balance of the governmental funds
is  a  negative  $20.3 billion.  These  new  fund  balance  classifications  reflect  the  implementation  of  GASB
Statement No. 54 and are defined in more detail in Note 1K.

The Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of the governmental funds shows
$195.3 billion in revenues, $198.0 billion in expenditures, and a net $1.6 billion in receipts from other financing
sources.  The  ending  fund  balance  of  the  governmental  funds  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2011,  was
$10.8 billion,  a  $1.0  billion  decrease  over  the  prior  year’s  restated  ending  fund  balance  of  $11.8 billion.  The
reasons for the change in the fund balance were a net decrease in intergovernmental revenue in the Federal
Fund, as a result of a reduction in economic stimulus funds received from the Federal ARRA, which exceeded
the increase of tax revenue.

Personal  income  taxes,  which  account  for  49.3%  of  tax  revenues  and  26.5%  of  total  governmental  fund
revenues, increased by $7.8 billion from the prior fiscal year. Sales and use taxes, which account for 32.0% of
tax revenues and 17.1% of total governmental fund revenues, decreased by $208 million over the prior fiscal
year.  Corporation  taxes,  which  account  for  9.0%  of  tax  revenues  and  4.8%  of  total  governmental  fund
revenues, decreased by $34 million from the prior fiscal year. Governmental fund expenditures increased by
$7.2 billion  from  the  prior  fiscal  year,  primarily  in  health  and  human  services  programs.  General  obligation
bonds  and  commercial  paper  of  $4.5 billion  were  issued  during  the  2010-11  fiscal  year;  however,  this  was
$7.5 billion less than the amount issued in the prior fiscal year.

The State’s major governmental funds are the General Fund, the Federal Fund, and the Transportation Fund.
The  General  Fund  ended  the  fiscal  year  with  a  fund  deficit  of  $19.9  billion.  The  Federal  Fund  and  the

14

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Transportation Fund ended the fiscal year with fund balances of $122 million and $7.8 billion, respectively. The
nonmajor governmental funds ended the year with a total fund balance of $22.8 billion.

General Fund: As shown on the Balance Sheet, the General Fund (the State’s main operating fund) ended the
fiscal year with assets of $12.0 billion, liabilities of $31.9 billion, nonspendable, restricted, and committed fund
balances of $148 million, $156 million, and $30 million, respectively, leaving the General Fund with a negative
unassigned fund balance of $20.3 billion. Total assets of the General Fund decreased by $849 million from the
prior fiscal year, mainly because of a $627 million decrease in amounts due from other governments. During
the  2010-11  fiscal  year,  the  General  Fund  continued  to  experience  cash  shortages  and  relied  on  internal
borrowing from the State’s other funds to meet its payment obligations. However, by June 30, 2011, long-term
borrowing from other funds had decreased by $1.3 billion to $8.9 billion. Even with this increase in short- and
long-term interfund payables, the total liabilities of the General Fund decreased by $518 million (1.6%).

As shown on the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of the governmental
funds,  the  General  Fund  had  $93.5  billion  in  revenues,  $90.4  billion  in  expenditures,  and  a  net  $3.5 billion
disbursement from other financing sources (uses) for the year ended June 30, 2011. Approximately 93.3% of
General  Fund  revenue  ($87.2  billion)  is  derived  from  the  State’s  big  three  taxes—personal  income  taxes
($50.8 billion), sales and use taxes ($27.0 billion), and corporation taxes ($9.4 billion). A total of $194 million in
revenue is included in the General Fund in compliance with GASB Statement No. 54. These revenues are not
considered  General  Fund  Revenues  for  any  budgetary  purposes  or  for  the  Budgetary/Legal  Basis  Annual
Report.  Most of these revenues ($190 million) are from unemployment programs.

During the 2010-11 fiscal year, total General Fund revenue increased by $8.4 billion, or 9.8%. Revenue from
personal  income  taxes  and  sales  and  use  taxes  increased  by  $7.7 billion  (17.9%)  and  $132  million  (0.5%),
respectively.  These  increases  were  primarily  the  result  of  California’s  slowly  improving  economy  and
decreasing  unemployment  rate.  Revenue  from  corporation  taxes  decreased  by  $34  million  (0.4%).  Revenue
from licenses and permits continued to surpass that of fiscal year 2008-09, the result of a temporary increase
in  the  assessment  rate  for  vehicle  license  fees  effective  May  2009  through  June  2011;  however,  this  year’s
revenues were $50 million less than in fiscal year 2009-10.

General Fund expenditures increased by $3.2 billion, to $90.4 billion. The programs with the largest increases
were  health  and  human  services,  which  increased  by  $3.7  billion,  to  $27.8  billion,  and  general  government,
which increased by $829 million, to $3.4 billion. The General Fund’s ending fund balance for the year ended
June 30, 2011, was a negative $19.9 billion, a decrease of $448 million from the prior year’s restated ending
fund balance of negative $19.5 billion. The increased expenditures for health and human services were mainly
the result of the reduction in Federal ARRA funds. The ARRA funding, which had reduced the General Fund’s
share of Medical Assistance program costs, was phased out during the last half of the fiscal year and ended
June 30, 2011. 

Federal  Fund:  This  fund  reports  federal  grant  revenues  and  the  related  expenditures  to  support  the  grant
programs. The largest of these program areas is health and human services, which accounted for $47.9 billion
(76.9%)  of  the  total  $62.3  billion  in  fund  expenditures.  The  Medical  Assistance  program  and  the  Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families program are included in this program area. Education programs also constituted
a  large  part  of  the  fund’s  expenditures—$9.1  billion  (14.6%),  down  $1.2  billion  (11.8%)  from  the  prior
year—most of which were apportionments made to local educational agencies (school districts, county offices
of  education,  and  community  colleges).  The  Federal  Fund’s  revenues  decreased  by  $8.6  billion  (11.2%),
approximately the same amount as its combined expenditures and transfers, which decreased ($8.6 billion),
resulting  in  only  a  $30  million  fund  balance  increase  from  the  prior  year’s  restated  ending  fund  balance  of
$91 million. The decrease in Federal Fund revenues and transfers was primarily the result of the phase out of

15

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

stimulus  funding  from  the  Federal  ARRA,  which  provided  additional  funding  for  many  health  and  human
services and education expenditures in the prior year.

Transportation Fund: This fund accounts for fuel taxes, bond proceeds, and other revenues used primarily for
highway  and  passenger  rail  construction.  The  Transportation  Fund’s  revenues  increased  by  23.6%  and
expenditures  decreased  by  17.3%.  Other  financing  sources  provided  net  receipts  of  $527  million.  The
Transportation Fund ended the fiscal year with a $7.8 billion fund balance, an increase of $788 million over the
prior year. 

Proprietary Funds

Enterprise Funds: The Unemployment Programs and State Lottery Fund each saw decreases of $324 million
and $23 million, respectively, in their net assets. Other State enterprise funds experienced increases in their
net assets during the 2010-11 fiscal year. The most significant increase was in the California State University
Fund, whose net assets increased by $575 million during the year.

As shown on the Statement of Net Assets of the proprietary funds, total assets of the enterprise funds were
$43.0 billion as of June 30, 2011. Of this amount, current assets totaled $12.7 billion and noncurrent assets
totaled $30.3 billion. The largest changes in asset account balances were a $2.7 billion increase in amount on
deposit with the U.S. Treasury in the Unemployment Programs Fund and a $484 million decrease in cash and
pooled investments in the Public Building Construction Fund. The total liabilities of the enterprise funds were
$42.2 billion. The largest liability of the enterprise funds is for bonds payable—$22.1 billion of revenue bonds
payable  and  $1.1 billion  of  general  obligation  bonds  payable.  During  the  2010-11  fiscal  year,  the  State
continued to obtain loans from the U.S Department of Labor to cover deficits in the Unemployment Programs
Fund. The balance due on these loans as of June 30, 2011, was $11.0 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion over
the prior year.

Total net assets of the enterprise funds were $806 million as of June 30, 2011. Total net assets consisted of
four  segments:  nonexpendable  restricted  net  assets  of  $22  million,  restricted  expendable  net  assets  of
$3.6 billion,  investment  in  capital  assets  (net  of  related  debt)  of  $1.4 billion,  and  unrestricted  net  assets  of
negative  $4.2 billion.  The  Unemployment  Programs  Fund  had  a  deficit  of  $6.9  billion,  a  $324  million  (4.9%)
decrease  in  net  assets  from  the  prior  year.  The  net  assets  of  all  other  enterprise  funds  experienced  small
changes during the year with the exception of the California State University Fund which had an increase to
net assets of $575 million.

As  shown  on  the  Statement  of  Revenues,  Expenses,  and  Changes  in  Fund  Net  Assets  of  the  proprietary
funds,  the  enterprise  funds  ended  the  year  with  operating  revenues  of  $33.7  billion,  operating  expenses  of
$36.6 billion, and net disbursements from other transactions of $108 million. The largest sources of operating
revenue were unemployment and disability insurance receipts of $24.7 billion in the Unemployment Programs
Fund  and  lottery  ticket  sales  of  $3.4  billion  collected  by  the  State  Lottery  Fund.  The  unemployment  and
disability insurance receipts in the Unemployment Programs Fund increased by $13.4 billion from $11.3 billion
in fiscal year 2009-10. These receipts came primarily from the federal government unemployment account to
pay unemployment and disability benefits. The State received more federal unemployment funds because less
funding from Federal ARRA economic stimulus was available to cover unemployment and disability benefits.
The  largest  operating  expenses  were  distributions  to  beneficiaries  of  $25.4  billion  by  the  Unemployment
Programs  Fund  and  personal  services  of  $3.7  billion  by  the  California  State  University  Fund.  The
Unemployment Programs Fund expenses were partially subsidized by $617 million of Federal ARRA economic
stimulus  funding  transferred  from  the  Federal  Fund.  The  ending  net  assets  of  the  enterprise  funds  at

16

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

June 30, 2011,  were  $806 million—$330 million  greater  than  the  prior  year’s  restated  ending  net  assets  of
$476 million.

Internal Service Funds: Total net assets of the internal service funds were $574 million as of June 30, 2011.
These net assets consist of two segments: investment in capital assets (net of related debt) of $141 million and
unrestricted net assets of $433 million.

Fiduciary Funds

The  State  of  California  has  four  types  of  fiduciary  funds:  private  purpose  trust  funds,  pension  and  other
employee benefit trust funds, investment trust funds, and agency funds. The private purpose trust funds ended
the fiscal year with net assets of $4.6 billion. The pension and other employee benefit trust funds ended the
fiscal  year  with  net  assets  of  $409.6  billion.  The  State’s  only  investment  trust  fund,  the  Local  Agency
Investment Fund, ended the fiscal year with net assets of $24.0 billion. Agency funds act as clearing accounts
and thus do not have net assets.

For the year ended June 30, 2011, the fiduciary funds’ combined net assets were $438.2 billion, a $69.7 billion
increase from prior year net assets. The increase in net assets for these funds was mainly attributable to an
increase in net investment income from the prior year of $34.6 billion (82.4%).

The Economy for the Year Ending June 30, 2011

Since  the  recession  ended  in  June  2009,  the  U.S.  has  seen  consecutive  quarterly  growth  in  real  Gross
Domestic Product. The first quarter of California’s 2010-11 fiscal year saw an increase in the national growth
rate  over  the  same  period  the  year  before,  2.5%  versus  1.7%.  For  the  remainder  of  the  fiscal  year,  U.S.
economic  output  continued  a  slow  growth  driven  primarily  by  consistent  growth  in  personal  consumption.
These positive national signs also started to play out at the state level during the year ending June 30, 2011. 

California’s  economic  recovery  continued  throughout  the  last  fiscal  year,  but  at  a  slow  pace.  Although
employment  levels  remain  well  below  their  pre-recession  peak,  total  non-farm  employment  grew  fairly
consistently.  By  June  2011,  total  non-farm  employment  was  1.3%  higher  than  at  the  beginning  of  the  fiscal
year. The state unemployment rate as of June 2011 was 11.8%, a decrease from the July 2010 rate of 12.4%.
Unfortunately, the declining unemployment rate was due in part to discouraged job seekers dropping out of the
job market. The state labor force fell by 111,000 unemployed, or 0.6%, from July 2010 to June 2011. Although
labor  market  conditions  were  generally  improving  during  the  second  half  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  labor  force
figures point to an uneven recovery, with many California residents not benefitting from the growth.

The state housing market has remained a weakness in the State’s economy. Home sales rose sharply in the
last months of 2010, increasing 12% from October 2010 through January 2011, but then fell 8.8% from March
through  June  2011.  However,  on  a  fiscal-year  basis,  home  sales  did  increase  2.3%  from  July  2010  to
June 2011.  Home  prices  have  yet  to  record  any  significant  increases,  but  the  pace  of  decline  slowed
substantially in the 2010-11 fiscal year. Both defaults and foreclosures in California were down in fiscal year
2010-11, with defaults declining 20.2% and foreclosures declining 11.4% from July 2010 through June 2011.
Residential construction permits were up 13.3% for the fiscal year, with construction employment up 1.8% for
the same time period. The housing market is still sluggish, but economic indicators support the view that the
market is slowly improving.

Other economic indicators point to a continued recovery in the State. State personal income showed consistent
increases  in  each  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2010-11,  increasing  5.5%  over  the  course  of  the  year.  Additionally,
consumer spending was a consistent strong element for the year. Seasonally adjusted taxable sales increased

17

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

9.8%  over  the  course  of  the  fiscal  year.  International  trade  and  tourism  contributed  to  California’s  economic
recovery during the year as well, with exports of goods and commodities from California increasing by nearly
15%.    

General Fund Budget Highlights

The  original  General  Fund  budget  of  $95.3  billion  was  reduced  by  $266  million.  This  decrease  is  mainly
comprised of a reduction in funding education programs per Section 12.42 of the 2010 Budget Act that was
partially offset by correctional program augmentations authorized by Assembly Bill 122, Chapter 42, Statutes of
2011.  During  the  2010-11  fiscal  year,  General  Fund  actual  budgetary  basis  expenditures  were  $91.9 billion,
$3.2 billion less than the final budgeted amounts.

Capital Assets and Debt Administration

Capital Assets

The State’s investment in capital assets for its governmental and business-type activities as of June 30, 2011,
amounted to $109.0 billion (net of accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes land,
state  highway  infrastructure,  collections,  buildings  and  other  depreciable  property,  and  construction  in
progress.  Depreciable  property  includes  buildings,  improvements  other  than  buildings,  equipment,  personal
property, intangible assets, certain infrastructure assets, certain books, and other capitalized and depreciable
property. Infrastructure assets, such as roads and bridges, are items that are normally immovable and can be
preserved for a greater number of years than can most capital assets.

Table 4 presents a summary of the primary government’s capital assets for governmental and business-type
activities.

The budget authorized $9.3 billion for the State’s capital outlay program in the 2010-11 fiscal year, not including
funding for state highway infrastructure and K–12 schools. State highway infrastructure assets are discussed in
more detail in the Required Supplementary Information that follows the notes to the financial statements. Of the
$9.3 billion authorized, $224 million was from the General Fund; $6.2 billion was from lease-revenue bonds;
$1.1 billion was from proceeds of various general obligation bonds; and $1.8 billion was from reimbursements,
federal  funds,  and  special  funds. These  amounts  include  reappropriations  and  other  funds  carried  over  from
previous budgets for continuing projects. 

The major capital projects authorized include: 

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

$200 million in lease-revenue bonds for the Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, for local youthful
offender rehabilitative facilities; 

$549  million  for  numerous  construction  projects  within  the  University  of  California,  the  California  State
University, and the California Community Colleges;

19

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

$919 million for projects to replace structurally deficient court facilities; and

$155 million from the High-Speed Passenger Train bond fund and federal funds for primary engineering
and environmental review along the San Francisco-to-Anaheim section of the high-speed rail system.

Note 7, Capital Assets, includes additional information on the State’s capital assets.

Modified Approach for Infrastructure Assets

The  State  uses  the  modified  approach  to  report  the  cost  of  its  infrastructure  assets  (state  roadways  and
bridges). Under the modified approach, the State does not report depreciation expense for roads and bridges
but  capitalizes  all  costs  that  add  to  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  State-owned  roads  and  bridges.  All
maintenance and preservation costs are expensed and not capitalized. Under the modified approach, the State
maintains  an  asset  management  system  to  demonstrate  that  it  is  preserving  the  infrastructure  at  or  above
established condition levels. The State is responsible for maintaining 49,518 lane miles and 12,893 bridges.

During the 2010-11 fiscal year, the actual amount spent on preservation was 13.1% of the estimated budgeted
amount needed to maintain the infrastructure assets at the established-condition levels. Although the amount
spent  fell  short  of  the  budgeted  amount,  the  assessed  conditions  of  the  State’s  bridges  and  roadways  are
better than the established condition baselines.

The Required Supplementary Information includes additional information on how the State uses the modified
approach for infrastructure assets; it also presents the established condition standards, condition assessments,
and preservation costs.

Debt Administration

At June 30, 2011, the primary government had total bonded debt outstanding of $111.5 billion. Of this amount,
$80.7 billion (72.4%) represents general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
State. Included in the $80.7 billion of general obligation bonds is $7.2 billion of Economic Recovery bonds that
are  secured  by  a  pledge  of  revenues  derived  from  dedicated  sales  and  use  taxes.  The  current  portion  of
general  obligation  bonds  outstanding  is  $2.4  billion  and  the  long-term  portion  is  $78.3 billion.  The  remaining
$30.8 billion  (27.6%)  of  bonded  debt  outstanding  represents  revenue  bonds,  which  are  secured  solely  by
specified revenue sources. The current portion of revenue bonds outstanding is $1.4 billion and the long-term
portion is $29.4 billion.

During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2011,  the  primary  government’s  total  long-term  obligations  increased  by
$7.3 billion over the prior year’s restated balance. Governmental activities net other postemployment benefits
obligation  had  the  largest  increase  ($2.6 billion),  but  other  notable  increases  occurred  in  general  obligation
bonds  payable,  compensated  absences,  and  mandated  costs.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  State  issued
$4.5 billion in new general obligation bonds for public education facilities, transportation projects, housing and
emergency  shelters,  and  various  water  and  flood  control  projects.  The  net  other  postemployment  benefits
obligation increased because the State does not fully fund the annual cost of these benefits.

Note  10,  Long-term  Obligations,  and  Notes  11  through  17  include  additional  information  on  the  State’s
long-term obligations.

The  State’s  general  obligation  bond  credit  ratings  remained  unchanged  during  the  fiscal  year  2010-11.  The
current  ratings  from  the  three  credit  rating  agencies  are  as  follows:  Standard  and  Poor’s  –  “A-”,  Moody’s
Investors Service – “A1”, and Fitch – “A-”. 

Recent Economic Condition and Future Budgets

Recent Economic Condition

From July 1 through December 31, 2011, economic data indicated that the California economy continued to
improve during the first half of fiscal year 2011-12. Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2010-11, the state has
gained 351,100 non-farm jobs. Other aspects of California’s labor markets are showing signs of improvement
as well.  By December 2011, the state’s unemployment rate had dropped from a seasonally adjusted 12.5% in
December 2010 to 11.1%. Nearly 213,000 California residents re-entered the labor market during the last five
months of 2011, while the number of unemployed residents simultaneously fell by 154,000.

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

Consumer spending has shown steady increases over the past two years, rising by more than 17.5% since its
low point in the second quarter of 2009. Personal income in California has already surpassed its pre-recession
peak, totaling $1.67 trillion in the third quarter of 2011 following almost two years of consecutive growth on a
quarterly basis.  

In  addition  to  growing  consumer  demand  from  domestic  sources,  international  trade  has  also  been
instrumental  in  assisting  in  California’s  recovery.  The  U.S.  dollar  remained  at  its  lowest  level  since  the
mid-1990s, benefitting California’s export market. Industrial machinery (including computers) has posted solid
gains  of  almost  12%  through  November  2011,  after  growing  by  more  than  30%  in  2010.  Additionally,  other
high-technology exports, including vehicles and parts, aircrafts, pharmaceuticals, and plastics, have continued
to  do  well  in  2011.  Commodity  exports  have  also  done  well  in  recent  years.  Over  the  past  two  years,  the
State’s  agricultural  and  natural  resources  industries  have  seen  double-digit  growth  in  the  production  of  fruit,
nuts, dairy products, and fuel and oil.

Home  prices  have  yet  to  rebound  across  the  state,  but  the  housing  market  has  stabilized.  Defaults  and
foreclosures have been trending downward for almost two years, despite a small uptick in defaults in the first
quarter  of  fiscal  year  2011-12.  As  this  “shadow  inventory”  dwindles,  demand  for  new  home  construction  is
expected  to  increase.  While  the  number  of  new  single-family  building  permits  was  still  declining  through  the
first six months of fiscal 2011-12, multi-family building permits have been trending upward since mid-2010. In
addition, new residential permit values steadily increased throughout 2011.  

Overall,  California  still  has  a  long  way  to  go  before  it  can  claim  recovery  from  the  recession.  Still,  most
indicators point to an economy that is not only in recovery mode, but is beginning to outpace that of the rest of
the United States. The labor markets are showing real signs of improvement and both incomes and consumer
spending are up from their respective lows. A weak dollar, coupled with California’s proximity to Asia and the
State’s  international  trade  infrastructure  at  its  ports  and  airports,  have  helped  to  boost  exports.  Housing
remains soft, but even there the market is beginning to show some improvement. Recent economic conditions
show that the worst is behind the state and that its recovery will continue.  

California’s 2011-12 Budget

California’s 2011-12 Budget Act was enacted on June 30, 2011. The Budget Act appropriated $129.5 billion:
$85.9  billion  from  the  General  Fund,  $34.2  billion  from  special  funds,  and  $9.4  billion  from  bond  funds.  The
2011  Budget  Act  continues  to  hold  General  Fund  spending  essentially  flat  for  a  third  year  –  $85.9  billion  in
2011-12, $86.6 billion in 2010-11, and $86.3 billion in 2009-10. The General Fund’s available resources were
projected  to  be  $88.5  billion,  resulting  in  a  projected  reserve  for  economic  uncertainties  of  $543  million.
General Fund revenues come predominantly from taxes, with personal income taxes expected to provide 42%
of  total  revenue.  California’s  major  taxes  (personal  income,  sales  and  use,  and  corporation  taxes)  were
projected to supply approximately 89% of the General Fund’s resources in the 2011-12 fiscal year.

The Budget enacted $27.2 billion in actions to solve a General Fund gap between resources and expenditures.
The  Budget  solutions  can  be  categorized  into  three  major  areas:  expenditure-related  solutions,  revenue
actions, and one-time loans and transfers. The $11.1 billion in expenditure-related solutions include ongoing
and  temporary  cost  or  service  reductions  primarily  in  health  and  social  services,  higher  education,  and
employee  compensation,  and  a  shift  away  from  the  General  Fund  for  transportation  debt  payments  toward
using weight fees. The majority of proposed new revenues assume $11.8 billion in growth due to an increase
in the baseline forecast of personal income and corporation tax revenues. These revenue actions would result
in a total increase in revenue of $13.2 billion. The Budget also included $2.9 billion in one-time loans, transfers,
and funding shifts, which include pausing for one year, building construction funded by the Trial Court Trust

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Fund for a savings of $743 million; a one-year decrease in the Stage 1 Child Care program, for a savings of
$369 million; and a one-time transfer of $155 million from the Gas Consumption Surcharge Fund.

The  Budget  introduced  a  major  realignment  of  public  safety  programs,  shifting  certain  state  program
responsibilities  and  revenues  to  local  governments,  primarily  counties.  This  realignment  affected  both
revenues  and  expenditures,  as  these  programs  will  receive  revenues  and  incur  expenditures  that  previously
were  the  stewardship  of  the  State.  In  total,  the  realignment  plan  provides  $5.6  billion  in  2011-12  to  local
governments to fund various criminal justice, mental health, and social service programs. The savings to the
General Fund is estimated to be $2.6 billion.

The  2011-12  Budget,  recognizing  the  potential  risk  to  the  State’s  fiscal  condition  if  revenues  fell  short  of
June 2011  estimates,  included  a  mechanism  for  further  reducing  the  current  year  expenditures.  As  of
December  2011,  total  General  Fund  revenues  were  determined  to  be  below  forecasted  amounts,  and  on
December  13,  the  Director  of  Finance,  as  required,  implemented  the  mechanism  and  reduced  by  $1  billion
remaining-year funding to various appropriations.

The  proposed  2012-13  Governor’s  Budget  provides  revised  revenue  and  expenditure  estimates  for  the
2011-12  fiscal  year.  If  no  corrective  action  is  taken  by  the  Governor  and  the  Legislature,  the  revised  gap
between  General  Fund  revenues  and  expenditures  is  expected  to  be  $4.1  billion  by  the  end  of  the  2011-12
fiscal  year.  State  cash  flow  data  as  of  January  31,  2012  indicates  that  this  gap  is  a  combination  of  actual
expenditures exceeding estimates by $1.4 billion and revenues falling short of estimates by $3.8 billion. The
revenue  shortfall  can  in  part  be  attributed  to  lower-than-estimated  personal  income  and  corporate  taxes.
Expenditures are greater than estimated because many of the cost-cutting measures included in the 2011-12
Budget  have  been  disputed  in  court  and  have  not  been  implemented.  Court  orders  and  delayed  federal
approval  related  to  several  budget-balancing  cuts  in  the  health  and  human  services  area  have  increased
budgeted  costs  by  nearly  $2 billion.  The  Governor’s  proposed  solutions  are  discussed  further  in  the  next
section.  

California’s 2012-13 Budget

The  Governor  released  his  proposed  2012-13  Budget  on  January  5,  2012.  The  proposed  Budget  projects  a
$9.2 billion gap between estimated revenues and state expenditures over the next 18 months. The $9.2 billion
figure is comprised of a $4.1 billion deficit carried over from the 2011-12 fiscal year and a $5.1 billion shortfall
in  the  2012-13  fiscal  year.  The  Governor’s  Budget  proposes  $4.2  billion  in  expenditure-related  solutions,
$4.7 billion in net new revenues, and $1.4 billion borrowed from special funds and other sources. If enacted,
the Governor’s proposed Budget would eliminate the 2011-12 and 2012-13 deficit and leave the State with a
surplus  of  $1  billion.  The  2012-13  Budget  continues  to  incorporate  those  solutions  implemented  in  the  prior
year Budget. It also assumes passage of the Governor’s proposed initiative in the November 2012 election. If
approved by the voters, this initiative will temporarily increase the personal income tax on the state’s wealthiest
taxpayers and temporarily increase the sales tax by one-quarter percent, generating an estimated $6.8 billion
to $9 billion for 2012-13.  

The 2012-13 Governor’s Budget projects (with all budget solutions enacted) that 2012-13 fiscal year General
Fund revenues and transfers will be $95.4 billion and expenditures will be approximately $92.6 billion, with a
$1.1 billion reserve. Proposed 2012-13 General Fund revenues and transfers are 7.7% more than the revised
2011-12  estimate  of  $88.6  billion,  while  2012-13  expenditures  are  7%  greater  than  the  revised  2011-12
estimate  of  $86.5  billion.  Almost  all  of  the  Governor’s  proposed  new  revenue  is  derived  from  plans  to
temporarily increase the sales tax and temporarily increase personal income tax on wealthy taxpayers, both of
which  the  Governor  will  submit  to  voters  in  November  2012.  A  portion  of  the  new  revenue,  $2.5  billion,  will
increase the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee to schools; the remaining $4.4 billion will prevent deeper cuts

23

State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report

to  schools,  protect  local  public  safety  funding,  and  assist  in  balancing  the  budget.  It  is  estimated  that  the
temporary  tax  increases  will  allow  the  State  to  pay  off  $33  billion  in  outstanding  budgetary  borrowing  and
deferrals  by  fiscal  year  2015-16.  While  additional  tax  revenues  will  mitigate  the  need  for  deeper  cuts  in
expenditures,  they  will  not  be  sufficient  to  close  the  entire  budget  gap.  Other  expenditure-related  solutions
include reductions of $1.4 billion for CalWorks and $1 billion in combined reductions to Medi-Cal and In-Home
Supportive Services.   

According  to  the  Legislative  Analyst’s  Office  (LAO),  California’s  nonpartisan  fiscal  and  policy  advisor,  the
administration’s  estimate  of  the  budget  shortfall  is  questionable.  LAO’s  revenue  estimate  is  lower  than  the
Governor’s, specifically those revenues attributable to the Governor’s initiative to be included in the November
2012  general  election.  The  LAO  estimates  that  personal  income  taxes  from  upper-income  taxpayers  will  be
lower  than  the  Governor’s  estimate,  which  could  result  in  the  Legislature  having  to  pursue  billions  of  dollars
more  in  budget-balancing  solutions.  The  LAO  credited  the  Governor’s  proposed  restructuring  of  the  school
finance  system,  community  college  categorical  funding,  and  education  mandates,  but  also  noted  that  the
Governor’s $1.4 billion in proposed savings related to Social Services and subsidized child care has merit but
may be too severe, and commented that potential savings could be less under other alternatives.

Fund Financial Statements

Total fund balances – governmental funds

$

10,758,275 

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the Statement of Net Assets are different from those in the
Governmental Funds Balance Sheet because:

(cid:129) Capital  assets  used  in  governmental  activities  are  not  financial  resources  and,  therefore,  are  not  reported  in

the funds.

Land
State highway infrastructure
Collections – nondepreciable
Buildings and other depreciable property
Intangible assets – amortizable
Less: accumulated depreciation/amortization
Construction in progress
Intangible assets – nonamortizable

(9,650,127)
7,794,602 
534,092 

(cid:129)  Other assets are not available to pay for current-period expenditures and, therefore, are not reported.

(cid:129) Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain activities, such as architectural,
procurement,  and  technology  services,  to  individual  funds.  The  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  internal  service
funds are included in governmental activities in the Statement of Net Assets.

100,297,090 

1,757,892 

574,355 

(cid:129) Bond discounts, premiums, and deferred issue costs are amortized over the life of the bonds and are included

(350,448)

in the governmental activities in the Statement of Net Assets.

(cid:129) General obligation bonds and related accrued interest totaling $79,080,213, revenue bonds totaling $7,994,249,

(88,409,802)

and certificates of participation and commercial paper totaling $1,335,340 are not due and payable in the
current period and, therefore, are not reported in the funds.

• Certain liabilities are not due and payable in the current period; therefore, adjustments to these liabilities are not

reported in the funds:

Compensated absences
Capital leases
Net other postemployment benefits obligation
Mandated costs
Workers’ compensation

Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of
Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities

(amounts in thousands)

Fund Financial Statements

Net change in fund balances – total governmental funds 

$

(1,024,345)

Amounts  reported  for  governmental  activities  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  are  different  from  those  in  the
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of Governmental Funds because:

(cid:129) Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the Statement of Activities, the cost of
those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense. This is the amount by which
net capital outlays exceed depreciation in the current period.

(cid:129) Revenues  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  that  do  not  provide  current  financial  resources  are  deferred  and  not

reported as revenues in the funds.

(cid:129) Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain activities, such as architectural,
procurement, and technology services, to individual funds. The net revenue (expense) of the internal service
funds is reported with governmental activities. 

(cid:129) Bonds and other noncurrent financing instruments provide current financial resources to governmental funds in
the  form  of  debt,  which  increases  long-term  liabilities  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets.  Repayment  of  bond
principal  is  an  expenditure  in  the  governmental  funds,  but  the  repayment  reduces  long-term  liabilities  in  the
Statement of Net Assets. The following amounts represent the difference between proceeds and repayments:

2,666,750

General obligation bond
Revenue bond
Certificates of participation and commercial paper

(1,564,891)
100,846 
6,779 

(1,457,266)

(cid:129) Some  expenses  reported  in  the  Statement  of  Activities  do  not  require  the  use  of  current  financial  resources

and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures in governmental funds.

Compensated absences
Capital leases
Net other postemployment benefits obligation
