To the Honorable Governor, 
Members of the State Legislature, and 
the Citizens of Alabama: 
 
I am pleased to submit to you the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the State of Alabama for the year ended September 
30, 2011.  I believe the information as presented is accurate in all material respects and complies with Article IV, Section 72 of the 
Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and Section 41-4-3(4) of the Code of Alabama 1975, as amended.  The completeness and fairness of the 
presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the State’s management.  This report complies with Article V, Section 137 of the 
Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and Section 36-16-1(6) of the Code of Alabama 1975, as amended, as the financial report for the State 
Auditor, State Treasurer, and State Comptroller. 
 
 

Introduction to the Report 

 
Internal Controls 
The internal controls in the State's accounting system have been designed to comply with Alabama statutes requiring the audit of receipts 
and receivables; the determination of legality and correctness of each claim and expenditure; and that funds are appropriated, allotted, and 
on deposit in the State Treasury before any warrant is issued.  The internal controls include manual pre-audit and automated system edits.  
As an additional control, the State Auditor's Office is responsible for a post-audit of the accounts and records of the Department of Finance 
and  the  State  Treasurer's  Office.    These  internal  accounting  controls  provide  reasonable,  but  not  absolute,  assurance  regarding  the 
safeguarding of assets against loss or unauthorized disposition and the reliability of the financial records from which the financial reports 
are prepared.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should not exceed the resulting benefits. 
  
Audit 
This CAFR has been audited by the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts.  The Examiners conducted their audit in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The Examiners' unqualified opinion appears at the 
beginning of the financial section of this report.  The State will also undergo an audit of federal programs to conform to the requirements of 
the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local 
Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.  Information relating to the single audit, including the schedule of expenditures of federal 
awards, and audit findings and recommendations, is issued in a separate report and will be available at a later date from the Department of 
Examiners of Public Accounts.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 34 requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview 
and analysis to accompany the Basic Financial Statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).  This letter of 
transmittal is intended to complement MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it.  The MD&A can be found immediately following 
the Independent Auditor’s Report.  The MD&A provides an overview of the State’s financial activities addressing both governmental and 
business-type activities reported in the government-wide financial statements.  In addition, the MD&A focuses on the State’s major funds, 
such as the General Fund, Education Trust Fund, Alabama Trust Fund, and Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund.   
 
 

 

Profile of the Government 

 
 
Reporting Entity 
This report presents financial information on all of State government as a single reporting entity.  While state law allows many state 
organizations to operate largely independent of the daily central control and scrutiny of the Department of Finance, State Auditor, and State 
Treasurer, this report combines the financial data of all state organizations in order to present a comprehensive picture of state finances.  
The numerous departments, agencies, elected officials, boards, commissions, authorities, colleges, universities, and other organizational 
units of the State are included in this report in accordance with standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  
These standards make a distinction between organizations which are considered to be part of the primary government of the State and those 
which are component units.  A component unit is defined as a legally separate corporate entity for which the State is considered to be 
financially accountable.  The criteria used to determine financial accountability include the appointment of a majority of the governing 
board, the ability of the State to impose its will on the organization, and the potential for the organization to be a financial benefit or 
financial burden to the State.  The State is also considered financially accountable for any organization having an independently appointed 
board if that organization is fiscally dependent on the State.  An organization is fiscally dependent if it is unable to adopt a budget, set rates 
or charges, or issue bonded debt without the approval of the State.  Component units can be reported as if they are a part of the primary 
government (“blended presentation”) if they provide services solely to the government, but most of the State’s component units do not and 
are therefore presented separately (“discrete presentation”) in these financial statements. The largest of the blended component units 
includes the Federal Aid Highway Finance Authority, State Parks Improvement Corporation, and the Building Renovation Finance 
Authority.  The major discretely presented component units are the Alabama Public School and College Authority, the Department of 
Mental Health, the Alabama Housing Finance Authority, the Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority, the Public Education Employees’ 
Health Insurance Board, the State Employees’ Health Insurance Board, the University of Alabama, Auburn University, and the University 
of South Alabama.  Note 1 to the financial statements provides a more complete description of the State’s reporting entity. 
 
Budgetary Controls 
Budgetary control is exercised through the Executive Budget Office of the Department of Finance based on the Appropriation Acts of the 
State Legislature.  Alabama's annual Appropriation Acts include legally adopted budgets for the General Fund, the Education Trust Fund, 
and other budgeted funds.  The Appropriation Acts identify the source of funding and the programmatic (functional) areas for which 
expenditures are authorized.  Both the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and the statutes require a balanced budget for annual financial 
operations.  In the event that revenue collections do not meet budget projections, the Governor is required to prorate appropriations and 
restrict allotments to prevent an overdraft in any fiscal year for which appropriations are made.  Allotments of appropriations are made 
quarterly based on plans of operations submitted by the departments and agencies.  These appropriations and allotments are enforced by 
automated edits that prevent allotments in excess of appropriations and expenditures in excess of allotments. Encumbrance accounting is 
utilized as purchase orders are issued to insure that purchase orders plus expenditures do not exceed allotment balances.  Controls are 
further tightened at fiscal year-end by verifying that the total of purchase orders plus expenditures plus any obligations (accounts payable) 
incurred against fiscal year appropriations do not exceed allotments, and remaining allotments do not exceed cash in the Treasury.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Cash Controls 
The State's controls on cash are fiscally very conservative.  Constitutional Amendment 26 prohibits the State Comptroller from drawing 
warrants on the State Treasury unless there is money on hand to cover those warrants.  This is more restrictive at the end of the fiscal year 
when obligations (encumbrances and accounts payable) cannot exceed the available cash balance (cash less warrants payable). This control 
is enforced by automated edits and tends to result in positive fund balances, even when generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
basis accruals are made in the financial statements.  Compliance with Amendment 26 is demonstrated in the following exhibits for the 
General Fund and the Education Trust Fund.

General Fund and Education Trust Fund Balances 
The fund balances for the General Fund and the Education Trust Fund for the last five fiscal years are presented in the following table. The 
fiscally conservative nature of Amendment 26 tends to produce positive fund balances.  However, in 2009 the Education Trust Fund used 
the provisions of Amendment 803 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 to borrow $437.4 million from the Alabama Trust Fund in order 
to  avoid  deeper  cuts  from  proration.    The  General  Fund  borrowed $161.6 in 2010 under the provisions of Amendment 803 to the 
Constitution of Alabama of 1901.  The full amount of both loans remain outstanding, leaving the Education Trust Fund with a deficit fund 
balance the past three years and the General Fund a deficit fund balance in 2011.

Cash Management 
The State Treasurer has the responsibility for the investment of cash balances.  In accordance with statutory requirements, treasury cash may 
be invested in time deposit open accounts, or demand accounts held in Alabama banks, or repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury securities 
and Agency securities. 
 
The State Treasurer has placed considerable emphasis on cash management.  In cooperation with state agencies, the receiving of funds into 
the State Treasury is expedited, with all excess funds earning interest.  Interest earnings during the 2011 fiscal year were as follows:  
 
                                      Bank Deposits 
                                      US Treasury and Agency Securities 
 
Interest income is deposited in the State's General Fund to be appropriated by the State Legislature for government operations.  In addition 
to the management of the investment of these funds, the State Treasurer initiates investments for several state agencies, with interest 
earnings being credited to those agencies. 
 
Long-term Financial Planning 
In 2011, the State Legislature passed the Education Trust Fund Rolling Reserve Act.  The Act caps the amount that the budget for the 
State’s largest operating fund, the Education Trust Fund (ETF) can grow from year to year.  The growth is capped at the average long 
term (15 years) growth in recurring revenues.    In fiscal years when revenues exceed the calculated cap, any excess revenues will first 
be used to repay amounts borrowed from the ETF Rainy Day Account.  If all Rainy Day Account amounts are paid in full, then any 
excess amounts go into a Budget Stabilization Fund.  Once the Stabilization Fund reaches 20% of the current year appropriations, any 
further excess revenues are split between a Capital Fund, Pension Liability Fund, and Retiree Health Benefits Liability Fund.   
 
Major Initiatives 
In addition to the passage of the Education Trust Fund Rolling Reserve Act, three major financial initiatives passed the State 
Legislature in 2011.  In an effort to reduce expenses the State Legislature raised the employee and teacher retirement contributions 
from 5 percent of salary to 7.25 percent effective October 1, 2011.  A further increase to 7.5 percent will take effect October 1, 2012.  
As a result the State was able to reduce its contribution for fiscal year 2012.  The State further reduced the cost of the retirement plans 
by eliminating the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) which allowed employees to retire and still continue employment for a 
period of three to five years while having their retirement earnings accumulate with interest.  The third major financial item to pass the 
legislature was a modification in post employment health insurance.  Employees and teachers who retire but are not yet 65 years old 
and eligible for Medicare must pay higher premiums for health insurance.

Economic Condition and Outlook 

 

 

 
 
In 2011, Alabama’s economy displayed signs of a very modest recovery.  In the face of a federal domestic debt ceiling crisis and a weak 
labor market, there was an increase in consumer spending. Alabama’s gross domestic product (ALGDP) rose by 2.2 percent.  Although the 
State’s unemployment was higher than the national average by 0.1 percent, it was an overall improvement from last year’s unemployment 
figure of 9.5 percent in Alabama.  The average unemployment rate for 2011 was 9.0 percent. State tax revenues increased 2.6 percent.  Sales 
tax receipts were a particularly encouraging sign for the economy with a growth of 3.6 percent for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. 
  
 
Alabama gained 3,800 jobs during the 12-month period ending in October 2011.  Industries with job increases included retail trade, 
professional and business services, durable manufacturing goods, and financial activities. On the other hand, construction and government 
shed the most jobs during the same period ending 2011. 
 
Manufacturing sector output rose by 4.1 percent during 2011, with an upsurge of 9.6 percent for manufacturers of fabricated metals.    Other 
contributors to the growth in the manufacturing sector output include petroleum and coal products, other transportation equipment, and 
motor vehicles and parts.  The construction sector’s output shrank by 0.3 percent in 2011 due to the continued weakness in both residential 
and commercial real estate.  Wholesale trade grew 3.95 percent and was accompanied by a 2.4 percent increase in employment.  Retail 
output rose 1.5 percent with an employment increase of 2.3 percent. 
 
There was a 17.9 percent leap in Alabama exports to $13.2 billion for the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 
according to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration.  Exports to Canada, Alabama’s largest 
trade partner, slumped from $3.2 billion in 2010 to $2.4 billion for the first three quarters of 2011.  Other major export destinations for 
Alabama products included Germany, Mexico, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.  For the first three quarters of 2011, 
transportation equipment exports amounted to $4.3 billion, a 17.3 percent increase from the same period in 2010.  Other major exports 
during the first three quarters of 2011 were chemicals, minerals and ores, machinery, paper products, primary metals, and computers and 
electronic products. 
 
Alabama’s economy is expected to expand moderately in 2012 with a 2.4 percent increase in output.  Non-agricultural employment will 
experience a slight gain of 1.1 percent.  Large manufacturing and services employers will be the major economic drivers in 2012.  These 
include firms in industries such as automotive manufacturing, steel, utilities, biotechnology, and the state’s major universities.  Due to 
uncertainties about federal budgets and spending, many of the state’s private contractors and government facilities engaged in aerospace and 
defense-related projects will be cautious in hiring and investment.

Awards 

 

 

 

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for 
Excellence in Financial Reporting to the State of Alabama for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2010.  This was the thirteenth consecutive year that the State has achieved this prestigious award.  In order to be awarded a 
Certificate of Achievement, a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report.  
This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements. 
 
A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only.  We believe that our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report 
continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility 
for another certificate. 
 
 
 
Production of this report would not have been possible without the assistance of all state organizations which supplied financial information 
vital to the accuracy of this report.  As we strive to produce this report in future years and to further enhance its quality, the continued 
support and cooperation of all agencies remain essential.  I also wish to express my appreciation to the entire staff in the Division of Control 
and Accounts, whose daily efforts to improve the accountability of state government make the quality of this report possible.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
The following is a narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the State of Alabama for the fiscal year ended September 30, 
2011.  Please consider the information presented here in conjunction with the letter of transmittal, which is located in the Introductory 
Section of this report, and the State’s financial statements, which immediately follow this discussion and analysis.  
 

 

 

Financial Highlights 

  The State’s net assets increased by $335 million during fiscal year 2011.  The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at the close 
of the fiscal year by $24.1 billion (net assets).  Of this amount, $19.9 billion was invested in capital assets (net of related debt), and 
$3.0 billion was Alabama Trust Capital.   

  The Change in Net Assets in governmental activities was $165 million.   
  Governmental activities have $3.3 billion in investments, $2.5 billion of which is held in the Alabama Trust Fund.  
  Revenues from program grants and contributions decreased $363 million as federal stimulus money ended late in the fiscal year.  
  Tax revenues were up for the first time in four years, increasing $190 million, or 2.6 percent as the economy began to recover. 
  Total revenues declined $105 million, or 0.5 percent.  Spending was therefore flat, increasing a mere $50 million, or 0.2 percent. 
  Spending on food assistance programs was up 21 percent, or $270 million, while spending in other areas was down.  
 
  The business-type activities reported net assets at year-end of $1.3 billion, an increase of $170 million for the fiscal year.  The 
Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund reduced its liability to the Federal Government by $239 million, and the Alabama 
Community College System had an increase in cash of $56 million.  

Investment earnings were down $185 million, a steep drop of 57.6 percent from the previous year.   

  The State’s total bond debt at the end of the fiscal year was $1.65 billion, a decrease of $36 million. 
  During the year the State made payments on general obligation bonds of $25 million.  The State issued $20 million in new revenue 

bonds and $197 million in refunding revenue bonds.  

  As of the close of the current fiscal year, the State’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $4.9 billion, a 
decrease of $211 million from last year.  $78 million of fund balance is in nonspendable form and $5.1 billion is restricted leaving 
a net deficit unassigned fund balance of $351 million. 

  On a budgetary basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and other sources by $52 million.  However, 
on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and 
other sources by $105 million.  The Budgetary Comparison Schedule in Required Supplementary Information reconciles these 
amounts and lists the accounting basis differences.  

  The General Fund budget was prorated by 15 percent and the Education Trust Fund budget was prorated by 3 percent because cash 

collections did not meet budget projections. 

 

 

 

Overview of the Financial Statements 

 

 

 

 

 
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the State of Alabama’s basic financial statements.  The State’s basic financial statements 
comprise three components:  1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. 
 This report also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial 
statements. 
 
Government-wide Financial Statements 
The government-wide financial statements provide a broad overview of the State’s financial position and activities measured in a manner 
similar to a private-sector business.  Assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are measured and reported using the economic 
resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting.  The government-wide financial statements exclude fiduciary activities. 
 
The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all of the State’s assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year.  The difference 
between the State’s assets and its liabilities is its net assets.  Increases or decreases in net assets from year to year may serve as a useful 
indicator of whether the financial position of the State is improving or not. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State’s net assets changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All changes 
in net assets are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  
Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., 
uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). 
 
Both  of  the  government-wide  financial  statements  distinguish  functions  of  the  State  that  are  principally  supported  by  taxes  and 
intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their 
costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities).  The governmental activities of the State include general government, 

               

                      

16 

 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
economic development and regulation, education and cultural resources, natural resources and recreation, health- physical and mental, 
social services, protection of persons and property, and transportation.  Examples of business-type activities of the State are operation of the 
State’s system of community and technical colleges, unemployment compensation services, operation of facilities for the distribution and 
sale of alcoholic beverages, and services for shippers at the Port of Mobile. 
 
The government-wide financial statements include not only the State of Alabama itself (known as the primary government), but also legally 
separate component units for which the State is financially accountable.  The major component units include the Public School and College 
Authority, Housing Finance Authority, State Employees’ Insurance Board, Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board, Water 
Pollution Control Authority, Department of Mental Health, University of Alabama, Auburn University, and University of South Alabama.  
Financial information for the component units is reported in a separate column from the financial information presented for the primary 
government.  The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis. 
 
Fund Financial Statements 
A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that the State uses to keep track of specific sources of funding 
and  spending  for  a  particular  purpose.    Fund  accounting  is  used  to  ensure  and  demonstrate  compliance  with  finance-related  legal 
requirements.  All of the funds of the State can be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds. 
 
Governmental funds 
Most of the State’s basic services are reported in governmental funds.  The governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term 
inflows and outflows of resources of these funds and the balances of those resources available at year-end.  These funds are measured and 
reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the 
information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide 
financial statements.  By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.  
Both the governmental fund Balance Sheet and the governmental fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances 
are followed by a reconciliation to the government–wide statements.  
 
The types of funds which are categorized as governmental funds are the General Fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt 
service funds, and permanent funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental fund Balance Sheet and in the governmental 
fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances for the General Fund, Alabama Trust Fund, Education Trust 
Fund, Public Road and Bridge Fund, Public Welfare Trust Fund, and Alabama Medicaid Fund, all of which are considered to be major 
funds.  Data from the nonmajor governmental funds are combined into a single aggregated column on the basic financial statements.  
Individual fund data for each of the nonmajor governmental funds can be found in the combining and individual fund statements and 
schedules section of this report. 
 
Proprietary funds 
Services for which the State charges customers a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds.  The State maintains two different types of 
proprietary funds: enterprise funds and internal service funds.  Like the government-wide statements, proprietary funds use the accrual basis 
of accounting. 
 
Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements. 
These funds report activities that provide supplies and services to the general public in a manner similar to private business enterprises. The 
major enterprise funds are the Unemployment Compensation Trust, State Port Authority, Alabama Community College System, and the 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.  Individual fund data for each of the nonmajor enterprise funds can be found in the combining and 
individual fund statements and schedules section of this report. 
 
Internal service funds report activities that provide supplies and services to other state agencies on a cost-reimbursement basis.  These funds 
are reported as governmental activities on the government-wide financial statements. These funds provide computer services, information 
technology, telecommunications, rental of office buildings, janitorial services, building maintenance, manufacturing activities, and liability 
protection. The internal service funds are aggregated in a single column on the proprietary fund statements.  
 
Fiduciary funds 
The State acts as a trustee or fiduciary for its employee pension plans.  It is also responsible for other assets that, because of a trust 
arrangement, can be used only for the trust beneficiaries.  The State’s fiduciary activities are reported in separate Statements of Fiduciary 
Net Assets and Changes in Fiduciary Net Assets.  These funds, which include pension and other employee benefits, private-purpose, and 
agency funds are reported using accrual accounting.  The government-wide financial statements exclude fiduciary fund activities and 
balances because the resources of those funds are not available to support the State’s own programs.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
The notes to the financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements.  They explain amounts shown in the financial 
statements and provide additional information that is essential to the fair presentation of the government-wide and fund financial statements.  
 
Required Supplementary Information 
In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary information 
which includes (1) budgetary comparison schedule reconciling the budgetary fund balances and generally accepted accounting principles 
fund balances at fiscal year-end, (2) ten year loss development information for the State Insurance Fund, (3) a schedule of funding progress 
for the Employees’ Retirement System, (4) a schedule of funding progress for the Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust, and (5) 
information about infrastructure assets reported using the modified approach.   
 
Other Supplementary Information 
Other supplementary information includes combining financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor enterprise funds, 
internal service funds, fiduciary funds, and nonmajor discretely presented component units.  These funds are added together by fund type 
and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements. 
 
 

Government-wide Financial Analysis 

 
Net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position.   The State’s combined assets exceeded liabilities 
by $24.1 billion as of September 30, 2011.   
 
The largest component (83 percent) of the State’s net assets reflects its investment in capital assets, such as land, buildings, equipment, and 
infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, tunnels), less any related outstanding debt used to acquire those assets .  The State uses these capital 
assets to provide services to its citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the State’s investment in 
its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other 
sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.  Capital Assets increased $439 million, which 
included $316 million in increases in infrastructure and infrastructure construction in progress. 
 
The total of Current and Other Assets is $7.9 billion, a decrease of $341 million, or 4.1 percent.  Included in that amount was a decrease in 
cash and cash equivalents of $277 million and a decrease in securities lending collateral of $114 million.  The balance of $7.9 billion 
includes $3.5 billion in investments, $2.5 billion of which is held in the Alabama Trust Fund.  Investments increased $116 million, $26 
million of which was from normal growth in the Alabama Trust Fund 
 
Long-term liabilities increased 2.3 percent, or $58 million.  Over half of total liabilities are in long-term liabilities and 72.4 percent of those 
long-term liabilities are in governmental activities.  The State has $2.6 billion in long term liabilities, which includes $1.6 billion in bonds 
payable and $478 million in other post employment health care benefit liabilities.  Bond debt decreased by $36 million while post 
employment health care benefit liabilities rose $94 million.  Other Liabilities for business-type activities decreased by $205 million, or  40.7 
percent, primarily because the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund reduced Due to Other Governments by $239 million by paying 
down an advance from the federal government.   
 
Restricted net assets represent resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or legislative restrictions on how 
they may be used.  Internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets.  The State’s net assets that are 
unrelated to capital assets include $5.0 billion in restricted net assets.  Unrestricted net assets represent the remaining amount of net assets 
that may be used to meet the State’s ongoing obligations that are not funded by resources that are restricted.  The State has a deficit in 
unrestricted net assets of $842 million.  Unrestricted net assets for governmental activities are a deficit of $1.1 billion, while business-type 
activities have a positive balance in unrestricted net assets of $292 million.

The table on the following page was derived from the government-wide Statement of Activities.  As a result of the excess of expenses over 
revenues, the State’s net assets increased by $335 million during fiscal year 2011.   Taxes provided $7.4 billion, or approximately 34 
percent, of the State’s total revenue.  Tax revenues increased by $190 million, or 2.6 percent, compared to the previous year as the economy 
began to improve.  Overall revenue decreased slightly by $105 million, or 0.5 percent.  Operating Grants and Contributions revenue 
decreased $353 million, or 3.4 percent, because federal grants from the federal stimulus programs ended late in the fiscal year.  
 
General revenues, which include taxes, were $8.6 billion, a decrease of $63 million, or 0.7 percent. Grants and contributions not restricted 
to specific programs dropped from $40.3 million to $9.1 million because in the previous year the State received  a $39.1 million bonus 
award from the federal government for outstanding performance in the State’s Medicaid program.  Investment earnings were $136 million, a 
steep drop from last year’s $321 million.  Charges for Services revenue increased $194.6 million, or 8.9 percent.  $136 million of the 
increase was for unemployment compensation. The revenue for unemployment compensation was higher because of a tax rate increase that 
was effective in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year; therefore, the revenue of the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 is greater than the 
revenue of the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Miscellaneous revenues are up $90 million, or 9.5 percent, on the strength of a one time 
boost of $51.5 million in revenues from unclaimed property.   
 
As a result of the overall slight drop in revenue, spending was flat as compared to the previous year, increasing $50 million, or 0.2 percent.  
Education and Cultural Resources spending was up $242 million, or 3.8 percent, and Social Services spending was up $210 million, an 
increase of 8.8 percent.  Education is supported by tax revenue sources, primarily sales tax and income tax, the two of which were up $204 
million.  In social services federal grants to the Department of Human Resources was up $207 million while expenditures rose $205 million. 
Within the Department expenditures rose for food assistance by $270 million, a 21.2 percent increase, while spending in other areas was 
generally down.   
 
In business-type activities, spending overall was down $273 million, or 10.3 percent.  The Unemployment Compensation Fund was down 
$316 million, some 23.9 percent because many claimants exhausted their maximum benefits and a special extra weekly benefit of $25 
expired in 2011.  Port Authority was up $5.1 million, or 4.1 percent as interest expense on bonds rose $4.4 million. The Alabama 
Community College System was up $21.3 million, or 2.4 percent, Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was up $12.4 million, or 4.9 percent, 
and Other Nonmajor Proprietary Funds was up $3.6 million, or 7.8 percent.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Governmental Activities 
Total revenues for governmental activities in fiscal year 2011 were $19.7 billion.   Revenue is categorized as either program revenue, which 
is generated by the program itself or is received from another government, or general revenue.  Program revenues include charges for 
services, operating grants and contributions, and capital grants and contributions.  Operating grants and contributions along with taxes 
together accounted for 83 percent of governmental activities revenue. 
 
Program revenues totaled $11.1 billion, down slightly from $11.2 billion the previous year.  Operating grants and contributions are the 
largest program revenues, and at $9.0 billion, make up 46 percent of total governmental revenues.  Operating grants and contributions 
decreased $163 million compared to the previous year. Operating grants and contributions to Medicaid were down $385 million.  Medicaid 
received $144 million less in federal stimulus grants than in the prior year.  Revenues for Certified Public Expenditures (CPE) in Medicaid 
were down $155 million.  CPE is used to fund the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program.  In the previous year the State exceeded 
its allowable DSH allotment for the federal fiscal year by $138 million.  Operating grants and contributions were down at Corrections by 
$118 million because of the loss of one time federal stimulus funds.  Operating grants and contributions at Human Resources was up $207 
million because of an increased need for food assistance while Emergency Management was up $60 million because of the April 2011 
tornado outbreak.   About 93 percent of operating grants and 98 percent of the capital grants were received from the Federal government.  
Capital grants and contributions were $929 million, a slight increase of $2 million over the previous year.  Charges for services increased 
$33 million, or 2.8 percent, compared to the previous year.  Miscellaneous revenues are up $89 million, or 9.5 percent, on the strength of a 
$51.5 million increase in revenues from unclaimed property.   
 
Taxes were $7.4 billion, an increase of $189 million from the previous year.  Revenue from all tax types were 37 percent of total 
governmental revenues earned during fiscal year 2011.  Of the $7.4 billion in tax revenues, the largest taxes were income taxes of almost 
$3.1 billion and sales and use taxes of $2.2 billion.  Sales and use taxes were up $79 million, or 3.7 percent, while income taxes increased 
$126 million, or 4.2 percent.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Total operating expenses for governmental activities in fiscal year 2011 were $19.2 billion.  Expenses for governmental activities are 
grouped by functional area.  The two largest functional areas were (1) Education and Cultural Resources and (2) Health.  These two areas 
together accounted for 67 percent of the governmental activities expenses for fiscal year 2011.  Social Services accounted for 13 percent of 
the governmental activities expenses.  Overall expenses increased by $324 million, or 1.7 percent.   
 
Education spending increased 3.8 percent, or $242 million.  Education and Cultural Resources now makes up 35 percent of governmental 
activity expenses, up from 34 percent last year.  Within Education and Cultural, 90 percent is support for local school systems and state 
universities.  Support for local school systems increased $182 million, or 3.9 percent, support for universities decreased $13 million, or 1.2 
percent.  
 
Health accounted for 32 percent of governmental activity spending, down slightly from 33 percent last year.  The Medicaid program 
accounts for 81 percent of Health spending and the Department of Public Health accounts for 12 percent.  Social Services spending 
increased $210 million, or 8.8 percent.  Within Social Services, food assistance was up sharply, rising $270 million while spending on other 
social programs generally declined.  Food assistance now makes up 60.4 percent of all social service spending.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Business-type Activities 
 
The largest business-type activity is the Alabama Community College System, which accounts for 79.2 percent of business-type net assets.  
The other major business-type activities are the Alabama Port Authority, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and the Unemployment 
Compensation Trust.  In fiscal year 2011 the net assets of business-type activities increased by $170 million. The Alabama Community 
College System capital assets increased by $37 million and cash grew by $56 million.  The Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund 
decreased its liabilities by repaying the Federal Government $239 million for advances received in prior years. Overall expenses were $2.4 
billion,  down  by  $273  million,  primarily  because  Unemployment  Compensation  expenses  decreased  $316  million,  or  24  percent. 
Unemployment Compensation expenses decreased because more claimants exhausted their benefits.  Also, the ARRA Federal Additional 
Compensation program, which provided an additional $25 weekly benefit ended in 2011.  Revenues of business-type activities totaled $2.2 
billion, a decrease of $40 million, or 1.8 percent.  Most of this revenue was self-generated program revenues; only $25.2 million of the $2.2 
billion revenues came from general revenues. The program revenues consisted of $1.2 billion of charges for services, a 16 percent increase, 
and $987 million of operating grants and contributions, a 16 percent decrease.   Operating Grants decreased because of the ARRA Federal 
Additional  Compensation  program  mentioned  above.    Charges  for  services  increased  because  of  an  assessment  rate  change  for 
Unemployment Compensation.   Of the $333.7 million in net transfers between governmental activities and business-type activities, most of 
the transfers are from the Education Trust Fund to the Alabama Community College System as mandated by the legislature in the 
appropriation acts.   
 
 

Financial Analysis of the State’s Funds 

 

Governmental Funds 
 
The focus of the State’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources. 
Such information is useful in assessing the State’s financing requirements.  In particular, unassigned General Fund balance may serve as a 
useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
At the end of fiscal year 2011, the governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $4.9 billion.  Of this total amount, $5.1 
billion is restricted to spending for specific purposes.  Those restrictions have been imposed by external parties, constitutional provisions, or 
enabling legislation.  Because restrictions exceed fund balance, there is a deficit in unassigned fund balance of $351 million.  Deficit 
unassigned fund balances outside the General Fund indicate that expenditures incurred for specific purposes exceeded the resources 
restricted for those specific purposes.  The largest restricted amount of $3.0 billion is for Alabama Trust Capital.  The Alabama Trust Fund 
originally was a permanent fund, but is now a special revenue fund because of Amendment 666 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 
which allows spending of principal equal to the previous year’s unrealized gains.  An additional $2.1 billion of governmental fund balance 
has been restricted for a wide variety of purposes which includes $143 million restricted for various capital projects and debt service. 
 
The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the State.  At the end of the current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance of the General 
Fund had a $25 million deficit, $3 million nonspendable fund balance, and $1 million assigned fund balance.  Revenues for the General 
Fund increased $24 million, or 2 percent, as taxes increased $19 million, fines, forfeits and court settlements increased $14 million, other 
revenue decreased $1 million, and investment income decreased $7 million.  Most of the tax increase, $23 million, is due to an increase in 
sales tax revenue.  The increase in fines, forfeits, and court settlement revenue is due to a one time court settlement with the pharmaceutical 
industry.   
 
Expenditures for the General Fund increased $66 million, or 5 percent.  Health expenditures increased $100 million, as overall grant 
payments related to Medicaid programs increased $117 million.  Medicaid hospital care program grants increased $87 million.  The 
Medicaid nursing home care program grants increased $22 million.  The Medicaid Health Support program increased $48 million.  
Medicaid Health Insurance Premiums increased $44 million.  The Medicaid Pharmaceutical program was down $64 million.  The Medicaid 
Physician Care Program was down $20 million.  Protection of Persons and Property expenditures increased $28 million, with $21 million of 
increase being spent for correctional facility operations.  Spending on General Government decreased $53 million.  Most of the decline was 
in employee salaries and benefits of $47 million.  Across all functional categories General Fund spending for grants and benefits were up 32 
percent due to Medicaid benefits being paid with general fund dollars in lieu of federal stimulus funds.  Rentals and lease expenditures 
increased 120 percent and transportation equipment operation expenditures increased 59 percent because of the spring 2011 tornado 
disasters. Spending for employee salaries and benefits was down 2 percent.  Due to Other Funds was relatively unchanged from the 
previous year because a large portion, $162 million, is a loan owed to the Alabama Trust Fund.  The money was borrowed in fiscal year 
2010 to alleviate revenue shortages in accordance with Amendment 803 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901. 
 
The Education Trust Fund (ETF) is the largest governmental fund of the State.  Revenues credited to the ETF are used for the support, 
maintenance, and development of public education in Alabama, debt service and capital improvements related to educational facilities, and 
other functions related to educating the State’s citizens.  Programs and agencies supported by the ETF include K-12 education, public 
library services, performing and fine arts, scholarship programs, the State’s education regulatory departments, and two and four-year

colleges and universities.  Funding from the ETF is also provided to non-state organizations that provide educational services to the people 
of Alabama.  Various tax sources are allocated to the ETF, the largest of which are income tax, sales tax, utility tax, and use tax.  Tax 
revenues in the ETF for fiscal year 2011 were up $154 million, or 3 percent as compared to fiscal year 2010.  Income tax revenues were up 
by $128 million and sales and use tax revenues were up by $18 million.  Expenditures, as limited by the budget, were up 3 percent, or $141 
million.  A large portion of the increase, $133 million, was in financial assistance to local school systems.  The ETF transferred out $382 
million, with the largest of these transfers going to supplement operations of the Alabama Community College System, a major Proprietary 
fund.  The Alabama Community College System received $338 million in transfers as mandated by the legislature in the appropriations acts. 
Due to Other Funds in the ETF of $445 million includes $437 million owed to the Education Rainy Day Account in the Alabama Trust 
Fund.  The ETF fund balance increased $41 million to a deficit of $203 million, as taxes receivable increased $71 million and payables had 
a net increase of $32 million.     
 
The Alabama Trust Fund consists of income from the sale or lease of rights for offshore exploration and drilling for oil and gas off the 
Alabama coast, as well as investment income earned on the accumulated capital.  Revenues from royalties and other payments related to the 
production of oil and gas decreased by $3 million in 2011.  Investment income plummeted from $256 million in 2010 to $97 million in 
2011, a decrease of $159 million. Various amendments to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 require that Alabama Trust income be used 
to support the General Fund, Forever Wild Land Trust, and a variety of state and local capital projects and debt service. In compliance with 
constitutional requirements, $215 million was transferred out to support these other funds. During the 2011 fiscal year, the amount 
constitutionally restricted for Trust Capital decreased by $29 million, a 1 percent decrease. 
 
The Medicaid Fund accounts for a portion of the Medicaid program that is funded by Federal revenues and certain other non-state revenue 
sources.   Federal revenues decreased 6 percent, or $241 million.  Overall, revenues were down 7 percent, or $341 million.  Expenditures 
decreased 4 percent or $187 million with the largest decrease being $307 million in hospital care program.  Nursing Home Care decreased 
$23 million with most of the decrease being due to payments being made in the Medicaid Fund last year, but were shifted to the General 
Fund this year.  Alternative care programs increased $20 million or 6 percent.  The net change in fund balance for Medicaid was a $120 
million decrease, bringing the total fund balance to an $82 million deficit. 
  
The Public Road and Bridge Fund is the general operating fund of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and receives all state revenues 
for that department, including all federal aid reimbursements.  Amendment No. 93 (as amended by Amendment No. 354) to the Constitution 
of Alabama of 1901 provides that monies derived from any fee, excise or license taxes levied by the State on motor fuels shall be expended 
for the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of public highways and bridges; the cost of highway rights-of-way; the 
payment of highway obligations; the cost of traffic regulations; and the expense of enforcing state traffic and motor vehicle laws.  For the 
most part, federal revenues remained fairly steady.  Expenditures increased $24 million, or 2 percent.  The cash balance rose from $425 
million to $477 million.  Of the $484 million fund balance, $26 million is in inventory of materials on hand and $458 million is restricted to 
cover construction and maintenance contracts.   
 
The Public Welfare Trust Fund is used to account for a broad range of social, protective, and financial assistance programs for citizens.  
This  is  the  major  operating fund of the Department of Human Resources.  89 percent of the revenue is from federal funds, but is 
supplemented by whiskey tax and a portion of the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board profits, sales tax, franchise tax, and beer tax. 
Overall spending rose $205 million, or 10 percent.  The economic downturn continued to create a huge increase in demand for food 
assistance, as spending increased $270 million, a 21 percent increase.  Spending on various children’s programs declined $13 million, or 3 
percent.  Expenses for the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program declined $31 million, a decrease of 28 percent.  State 
administration costs for the fund declined $12 million, a decrease of 21 percent.  The fund balance at year end is $65 million, a decrease of 
$18 million.  The small fund balance is normal for this fund, since the Federal Cash Management Improvement Act does not allow the State 
to draw money and hold it for more than a few days.  
 
The Education Trust Fund & General Fund had negative fund balances at September 30, 2011.  This is not typical for the State’s major 
governmental  funds  because  the  fiscally  conservative  nature  of  the  State’s  controls  generally  results  in  positive  fund  balances. 
Constitutional Amendment 26 requires the State to have on hand at year end in each budgeted fund enough cash to cover all outstanding 
warrants and any remaining unspent obligations (encumbrances and accounts payable).  The General Fund and Education Trust Fund had 
negative fund balances at September 30 resulting from the interfund loans owed to the Alabama Trust Fund.  Without the loans, the accrual 
of taxes receivable in the General Fund and Education Trust Fund almost always assures a positive fund balance.  Medicaid often has a 
negative fund balance because GAAP requires the accrual of claims payable and the related federal receivable, but not the State matching 
amounts which will be recorded as revenues when received in the next fiscal year.  The Public Road and Bridge Fund retains enough cash 
to cover their outstanding construction contracts and commitments so that fund historically has a large fund balance.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Proprietary Funds 
 
The State’s proprietary fund financial statements provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements, 
but in more detail.  During the fiscal year, total net assets for all enterprise funds increased by $170 million.   
 
The Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund reversed its downward trend as net assets increased by $120 million in contrast to a prior 
year decrease of $131 million.  Revenues increased because the assessed rate was higher for the first quarter of the fiscal year as compared 
to the first quarter of the prior year.  Also, a special assessment was collected September 9, 2011 which provided additional revenue to be 
used to pay interest owed to the Federal Government.  The assessment was approximately $6 for each employee.  Benefits dropped $320 
million as more claimants exhausted their benefits and the ARRA Federal Additional Compensation program, which provided an additional 
$25 weekly benefit, ended in 2011.  Also, revenue from Federal grants decreased $201 million because of the end of the ARRA stimulus 
program. Due to Other Governments decreased by $239 million because the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund repaid advances 
owed to the Federal Government.  The trust fund has a $33 million deficit at year end because of the $44 million remaining balance for 
Federal Government advance. 
 
The net assets of the State Port Authority are $311 million, a decrease of $6 million.   A contributor to the decrease in net assets for 2011 
was the elevated non-operating expenses.  Interest expense increased from approximately $13 million to $17 million as a result of the 
issuance of the Series 2010 long term fixed rate bonds to refund the Series 2008B and Series 2009A long-term bond anticipation notes that 
had been indexed to the historically low LIBOR rates.  The economy has a significant effect on the State Port Authority’s interest expense 
as well as its operating revenues.  Operating revenues were $122 million, an increase of $15 million, or 14 percent over the prior year, 
resulting from a number of factors.  Revenues at General Cargo/Intermodal Terminal increased by $10 million, in large part due to the ramp 
up of the Pinto Island Steel Terminal.  The Terminal Railway experienced an increase of $2 million, largely due to higher rates for handling 
railcars containing hazardous materials. Other operating revenues experienced increases associated with new surcharges and an increase in 
vessel traffic.    
 
The Alabama Community College System’s net assets increased $62 million in 2011, primarily because of increases in charges for services 
and increases in Federal Grants.   The College System has $37 million more in capital assets and $56 million more in cash available at year 
end.  The College System has an operating loss of $707 million.  However, federal grants of $402 million and transfers from the ETF and 
other governmental funds of $363 million result in an increase in net assets.   
 
The net assets of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board declined by $6 million in fiscal year 2011, resulting in a $19 million deficit. The 
Board is required by law to distribute all of its profits and cannot own real property; therefore, net assets generally will remain negative.  
 
 

Budgetary Highlights 

 

General Fund 
 
The original budget for the General Fund was decreased by a net of $61 million during fiscal year 2011.  Expenditures were decreased by 
$41 million and Transfers Out decreased by $20 million, and the increases and decreases are reflected in the final budget on the Budgetary 
Comparison Schedule.  15 percent proration was declared on March 31, 2011 because cash collections were not meeting budget projections. 
This decreased the budget by $250 million.  The Medicaid Agency, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Mental Health, the 
Department of Public Health, the Department of Human Resources, and the Department of Public Safety were cut by $71 million, $51 
million, $16 million, $16 million, $15 million, and $11 million, respectively.   Actual tax revenues were $68 million less than the final 
budget because f the weak economy.  Also, the budgeted tax revenues were reduced by $44 million because cash collections were short. 
 
There were significant budgetary variances between the final budget and actual results.  Unexpended and reverted appropriations from fiscal 
year 2011 were reappropriated to fiscal year 2012; therefore, many agencies did not spend all of their appropriations during fiscal year 
2011.  The Medicaid Agency only has $2 million to carryover which is $33 million less than the prior year because most of the funds were 
spent. The Department of Public Safety, the Legislature, Department of Corrections, Department of Economic and Community Affairs, and 
the Department of Finance have $2 million, $2 million, $4 million, $3 million, and $3 million, respectively.  These appropriations will be 
needed in the future because federal stimulus funds have ended and projections for State revenues are not improving. 
 
There were budget increases to various agencies as a result of supplemental appropriations which totaled $156 million. The Medicaid 
Agency received $126 million of this supplemental appropriation.  The Medicaid Agency uses these funds to match the federal grants for 
Medicaid programs.  Conditional and other appropriations were approximately $33 million to various agencies.  Conditional amounts are 
not included in the budget until the conditions have been met.  Some expenditures are required by law to be fully funded, and estimated 
amounts are approved in the General Fund appropriation bill.  Increases to these estimated amounts do not require a new bill and are 
included as other appropriations. Emergency appropriations of $2 million are included in the original budget and are included in the 
budgeted amounts as Other on the Budgetary Comparison Schedule. Also, there was a supplemental appropriation of $4 million for the 
                      

25 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Departmental Emergency Fund.  Emergency appropriations cannot exceed two percent of the total amount appropriated.  On a budgetary 
basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and other sources by $52 million.  However, on a GAAP (Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and other sources by $105 million.  
The Budgetary Comparison Schedule in Required Supplementary Information reconciles these amounts and lists the accounting basis 
differences. 
 
 

 

 

Capital Asset and Debt Administration 

Capital Assets 
 
At the end of fiscal year 2011 the State had invested $20.9 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, in a broad range of capital assets (see

As allowed by GASB Statement No. 34, the State has adopted the modified approach for reporting roadway and bridge infrastructure assets. 
Under the modified approach, depreciation is not recorded.  Infrastructure costs that result in an increase in the capacity or an improvement 
in  the  efficiency  of  the  infrastructure  network  are  capitalized  and  added  to  the  historical  cost  of  the  assets.    Costs  that  allow  the 
infrastructure network to be used efficiently over the expected useful life of the assets are expensed as general maintenance costs.  Certain 
maintenance costs that extend the useful life of the assets but do not increase capacity or efficiency are classified as preservation costs.  
Preservation costs are expensed and reported in lieu of a charge for depreciation expense.  
 
Extensive project documentation is required to meet various federal and state guidelines concerning the construction of infrastructure.  The 
completeness of this documentation affects the timing of project capitalization.  The State capitalizes infrastructure when all costs for a 
project are incurred and all project documentation is satisfactorily completed, filed, and accepted with the appropriate entities.  Projects that 
meet the cost and documentation criteria are closed, and appropriate entries are made to adjust the Infrastructure Construction in Progress 
and Infrastructure asset accounts annually.  Due to the documentation requirements, there can be substantial time lags between the date a 
project is put into service on the State’s roadway network and the date the project is capitalized.  A significant portion of Infrastructure 
Construction in Progress consists of projects that have been put into service and maintenance costs could have been incurred. 
 
The State uses the International Roughness Index (IRI) to measure and monitor pavement conditions.  The IRI is a standard representing the 
perceived smoothness of pavements while traveling in passenger cars.  A lower IRI measurement represents a smoother condition of 
pavement.  The United States Department of Transportation developed suggested values for IRI of <60 inches/mile to >220 inches/mile to 
                      

26 

 

 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
grade the smoothness condition of the roadway.  A range of 60 to 94 is considered “Good” condition, with negligible maintenance required, 
and a range of 95-119 for Interstate Highways or 95-170 for non-interstate highways is considered “Fair”, requiring routine maintenance 
such as pavement patching.  The weighted average rating of Alabama’s roads was 82.03, which exceeds the State’s goal.  
 
The State maintains 5,395 bridges and culverts.  The State rates the major structural components and deck area of the bridge or culvert on a 
scale of one to ten and assigns a weighted rating to the bridge or culvert.   The State expects those bridges and culverts to be maintained at a 
rating  within  the  range  of  5  -  6.99,  which  is  considered  “satisfactory,”  meaning  the  structural  elements  are  sound  but  have  minor 
deterioration.  The actual weighted average rating for the most recent condition assessment was 6.60, in the upper end of the satisfactory 
range.  
 
In fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the State estimated it would need to spend $319.6 and $306.0, respectively, to preserve and maintain all 
roadway assets and $10.0 million in each year to preserve all bridge assets at or above the “Established Condition Levels” presented above. 
In fiscal year 2011, the State spent $375,563,000 for roadway preservation and $60,306,000 for bridge preservation. The State spent 
$387,793,000 for roadway preservation and $47,020,000 for bridge preservation in fiscal year 2010.   In the next fiscal year, the Alabama 
Department  of  Transportation  estimates  that  it  will  need  to  spend  approximately  $334,931,000  to  preserve  all  roadway  assets  and 
approximately $10,000,000 to preserve all bridge assets at or above the “Established Condition Levels” presented above.     
 
More  detailed  information  about  the  State’s  capital  assets  is  presented  in  Note  3  to  the  financial  statements  and  in  the  Required 
Supplementary Information section. 
 
 
Long-term Debt 
 
The only method under which general obligation debt can be incurred by the State is by amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901. 
The debt prohibition does not apply to debts incurred by separate public corporations functioning as State instrumentalities.  The revenue 
bonds issued by these corporations are limited obligations of the corporation, not general obligations of the State, and the full faith and 
credit of the State is not pledged for their repayment.  Certain revenues, usually earmarked taxes or revenues generated from the project 
financed, are pledged for the payment of the debt.  Some of these corporations are blended with the primary government and some are 
reported  discretely.    The  State  and  its  component  units  issue  serial  and  term  bonds  and  capital  appreciation  bonds.    Alabama  has 
traditionally received high bond ratings from both Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investors Service.  Currently, an   
exception is the upper medium bond ratings for the Tobacco Settlement Revenue Bonds issued by the Alabama Twenty-first Century 
Authority, a component unit of the State.  Also, Fitch Ratings Ltd and Standard and Poor’s Corporation lowered the bond ratings for the 
State Port Authority to BBB+ in September 2009.  Moody’s withdrew their rating for the State Port Authority in June 2009.

Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates 

 

 

On March 16, 2012 the Governor declared 10.6 percent proration of the fiscal year 2012 General Fund budget.  The Governor cited several 
factors in his declaration, the largest of which is the need for tens of millions of dollars in State funding required for tornado recovery.  Also 
cited were poor market conditions which resulted in low interest earnings on State investments which benefit the General Fund.    
 
The Education Trust Fund budget for fiscal year 2012 is $249 million greater than fiscal year 2011.  The K-12 Local Boards of Education 
received an appropriation increase of $175 million for fiscal year 2012 over fiscal year 2011 from the Education Trust Fund.  The 4 year 
Universities received an increase of $55 million.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
 
Total tax collections are up approximately 3 percent for the first 5 months of fiscal year 2012 as compared to the first 5 months of fiscal 
year 2011.  The State’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, at 7.8 percent in January 2012, was down from December 2011’s rate of 8.0 
percent, and well below January 2011’s rate of 9.3 percent.  However, many unemployed workers have exhausted their unemployment 
benefits.  The number of employed workers actually decreased from January 2011 to January 2012 from 1,975,000 to 1,958,000.

Some of the State's revenues will be collected after year-end, but
     are not available soon enough to pay for the current period's
     expenditures, and therefore are deferred in the funds.
Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs
     of certain activities, such as insurance and information technology, 
     to individual funds.  The assets and liabilities of the internal
     service funds are included in governmental activities in the
     statement of net assets.
Long-term liabilities are not due and payable in the current period
     and therefore are not reported in the funds.
          Capital Leases, Notes, and Mortgages

Long-term bonded debt is not due and payable in the current period and 
     therefore is not reported in the funds.  Unamortized discounts, unamortized
     premiums, unamortized loss, deferred debt financing costs, and interest payable
     are not reported in the funds.  However, these amounts are included in the
     Statement of Net Assets.  This is the total effect of these balances on the statement.

STATE OF ALABAMA
RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES 
IN FUND BALANCES OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES 

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011
(Amounts in Thousands)
Net Change in Fund Balances for Governmental Funds
Governmental funds report capital outlay as expenditures.  However, in the Statement of Activities,
     the cost of those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense.
     This is the amount by which capital outlays exceeded depreciation in the current period.
          Capital Outlay
          Depreciation Expense

510,067
(77,910)

In the Statement of Activities, only the gain (loss) on the sale of assets is reported, whereas in the
     governmental funds, the proceeds from the sale increase financial resources.  Thus, the change
     in net assets differs from the change in fund balance by the cost of the assets sold.
Some capital additions were financed through capital leases.  In the governmental funds, a capital
     lease arrangement is considered a source of financing, but in the statement of net assets, the
     lease obligation is reported as a liability.
In the Statement of Activities, the change in the balance of inventories is expensed, whereas in 
     the governmental funds, the change in the balance of inventories is adjusted to nonspendable  
     fund balance. 
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current financial resources are not
     reported as revenues in the funds.
Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain activities, such as 
     insurance and information technology, to individual funds.  The net revenue (expense) of the 
     internal service funds is reported with governmental activities.
Capital assets reassigned to internal service funds from the general government are reported in  
    internal service funds as transfers in, but in the Statement of Activities such interfund
    activity is eliminated.

     reduces long-term debt in the Statement of Net Assets.

Certain expenditures are reported in the funds.  However, they either increase or decrease long-term

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A. Reporting Entity 
As  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  these  financial  statements  present  the  State  of  Alabama  (the  primary 
government)  and  its  component  units.    Component  units  are  legally  separate  organizations  ("public  corporations")  for  which  the 
primary government is financially accountable.  Generally, the primary government is financially accountable if it appoints a voting 
majority of the organization's board and it can either 1) impose its will on the organization, or 2) there is a financial benefit/burden 
relationship.  If the primary government does not control the board, it may be financially accountable if the organization is fiscally 
dependent on the State.  Organizations making up the primary government and its component units are summarized in the following 
paragraphs. 

1. Primary Government 
All state departments, agencies, elected officials, boards, commissions, authorities, committees, halls of fame, educational institutions, 
and other state organizations (hereafter referred to as "agencies") which are not legally separate are, for financial reporting purposes, 
part  of  the  primary  government.    All  agencies  and  funds  that  operate  from  within  the  State  Treasury,  except  those  listed  later  as 
component units, are part of the primary government.  The following non-Treasury agencies operate largely independent of the control 
of the State Comptroller, State Auditor, and State Treasurer, but lack the corporate powers to make them legally separate and are 
therefore part of the primary government: 
 
 Alabama Community College System  
Alabama Fire College 
Alabama Technology Network 
Athens State University 
Aviation Hall of Fame 
Cahawba Advisory Committee 
Commercial Mobile Radio Service Board 
Dental Examiners Board 
Dental Scholarships Awards Board 
Gorgas Memorial Board 
Alabama Industrial Development and Training Institute 
 Marion Military Institute 
Medical Examiners and Licensure Commission  
Motor Sports Hall of Fame 
Optometric Scholarships Awards Board  
Optometry Board 
Pharmacy Board 
Pilotage Commission 
Podiatry Board 
School of Fine Arts 
St. Stephens Historical Commission 
State Port Authority 
Women's Hall of Fame 

2. Blended Component Units 
Blended component units are legally separate but they exist solely to provide services (usually financing) exclusively to the State.  
Because  of  this  close  relationship,  they  are  blended  with  and  reported  as  though  they  are  a  part  of  the  primary  government.    All 
references in the financial statements or elsewhere in these notes to the term "primary government" will encompass both the primary 
government and the blended component units. 
 
The following blended component units were created for the purpose of financing capital expenditures for the State.  Each issues 
revenue bonds that are limited obligations of the component unit.  Their boards consist of state officials and specific state revenues are 
pledged for bond repayment.  Those marked with a † are currently inactive and had no financial balances or activity in the past fiscal 
year.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
Agriculture Markets and Coliseum Authority † 
Corrections Institution Finance Authority 
Federal Aid Highway Finance Authority 
Highway Authority † 
Industrial Access Road and Bridge Authority † 
Toll Road, Bridge and Tunnel Authority † 
Judicial Building Authority 
Alabama Trade School and Junior College Authority † 
Gulf State Park Authority† 
 
The  Building  Renovation  Finance  Authority  has  the  same  characteristics  as  those  in  the  previous  paragraph,  but  has  the  added 
responsibility of operating, maintaining, and renting buildings in the capitol complex that are occupied by state departments.   
 
The State Parks System Improvement Corporation renovates, improves, maintains, and constructs assets belonging to the State Parks 
System.  The six members of the Corporation are state officials. 
 
The Forensic Science Bond Authority has the power to acquire, construct, and equip laboratories and other facilities for the State 
Department of Forensic Sciences.  The four members of the Authority are state officials.  The Authority had no financial activity in 
the past fiscal year. 
 
The Alabama State Parking Deck Authority has the authority to sell bonds, operate, maintain, and rent space in a parking deck on a 
block in the capitol complex.  The Authority has remained inactive since the enabling legislation was passed. 
 
The Educational Television Foundation Authority raises and manages money and property for the benefit of the Alabama Educational 
Television  Commission,  a  State  agency.      The  Authority  consists  of  thirteen  members  who  are  appointed  by  the  Alabama  Public 
Television Commission.  As a non-profit public corporation, the Authority provides financing flexibility that the Commission, as part 
of the primary government, would not otherwise have.  
 
The Public Health Care Authority was created solely to build, furnish, and maintain facilities for the use of the Department of Public 
Health, a State agency, financing those facilities with debt issuances which are backed by leases with the Department.  Three of the 
seven board members are state officials but the remaining board members are not appointed by the State and the Authority is not 
fiscally dependent on the State.  The Authority is included in these financial statements because it would be misleading to exclude 
them because of the close relationship with the State.    
 

3. Discretely Presented Component Units 
Discretely presented component units are organizations, which are legally separate and do not exist to provide services exclusively to 
the primary government.  Providing services to the citizens of the state is not considered the same as providing services to the primary 
government institution.  Financial information for discretely presented component units is segregated on the financial statements and 
the notes in the "Component Unit" columns in order to emphasize that they are legally separate. 
 
Most of the discretely presented component units have boards that are controlled by the primary government through the appointment 
of a majority of the board members.  The State has been determined to be financially accountable for each organization because it can 
impose its will on each organization.  Unless otherwise noted, financial accountability for each organization described below exists at 
least in the ability of the State to modify the component unit's budget.  Other manifestations of financial accountability may also exist.  
 
For discretely presented component units whose boards are not controlled by the State, the organization has been determined to be 
fiscally dependent on the State.  Unless otherwise noted, fiscal dependency exists at a minimum in the State’s ability to modify the 
component unit’s budget.  Other manifestations of fiscal dependency may also exist. 
 
When audited financial statements for a discretely presented component unit exist, the address at which such financial statements can 
be obtained is included in the following paragraphs describing each component unit.  For all other discretely presented component 
units, complete financial statements may be obtained from the State of Alabama, Office of State Comptroller, RSA Union Building, 
Suite 206, Montgomery, AL  36130-2602. 
 
The Water Pollution Control Authority operates a revolving loan fund to aid municipalities in financing the construction of wastewater 
treatment  facilities.    A  five-member  board  of  directors  made  up  of  ex  officio  members  governs  the  Authority.    Audited  financial 

 
58 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
statements  of  the  Authority  may  be  obtained  from  the  Alabama  Department  of  Environmental  Management,  1400  Coliseum 
Boulevard, Montgomery, AL  36130. 
 
The Alabama Drinking Water Finance Authority operates a revolving loan fund to aid local governments in financing the construction 
of  sanitary  drinking  water  facilities.    A  five-member  board  of  directors  made  up  of  ex  officio  members  governs  the  Authority.  
Audited financial statements of the Authority may be obtained from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, 1400 
Coliseum Boulevard, Montgomery, AL  36130. 
 
The  Department  of  Mental Health  provides  mental  health  services  to  the  people of Alabama.    The  Governor  of  the  State  and  the 
commissioner  of  the  Department  constitute  a  public  corporation  and  are  advised  by  a  sixteen-member  board  of  trustees.    The 
commissioner and ten of the board members are appointed at the discretion of the Governor.  The Mental Health Finance Authority 
exists to provide financing services to the Department, is therefore a blended component unit of the Department, and is included in all 
amounts reported for Mental Health. 
 
The Crime Victims Compensation Commission awards compensation for economic losses arising from criminal conduct and works to 
change laws to benefit crime victims.  The Commission consists of three members who are appointed by the Governor. 
 
The Tennessee Valley Exhibit Commission was created to operate a public exhibit based primarily on the history of and ongoing 
activities  of  the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority  and  various  other  public  entities  involved  in  energy  research  and  development.    The 
sixteen-member Commission is appointed by the Governor.  The building which housed the exhibit has been sold and the board is no 
longer actively operating but it has not been legally dissolved by the legislature.  
 
The State Industrial Development Authority issues bonds and uses the proceeds to make grants to local industrial development boards.  
All members of the Authority are elected or appointed state officials. 
 
The Alabama Education Foundation encourages donations of money for local school systems and invests the money for the benefit of 
each local system.  The Foundation is governed by a twelve-member board that is made up of state officials and other individuals 
appointed by state authorities. 
 
The  Supercomputer  Authority  operates  a  supercomputer  for  the  use  of  educational  and  governmental  research  institutions,  private 
businesses, and individuals.  The twenty directors of the Authority are appointed by state officials. 
 
The Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board operates a health insurance plan for employees of public school systems, 
state junior colleges, colleges, universities, and related education administrative employees.  The State does not appoint a majority of 
the Board but the Board is fiscally dependent on the State.  Audited financial statements of the board may be obtained at 201 South 
Union Street, Montgomery, AL  36104-0001. 
 
The State Employees’ Insurance Board operates health insurance plans for state employees and for employees of local governments.  
The State does not appoint a majority of the Board but the Board is fiscally dependent on the State.  Audited financial statements of 
the board may be obtained at Suite 200, 201 South Union Street, Montgomery, AL  36104. 
 
The boards of the four-year colleges of the State, except for the University of Alabama, are appointed by the State.  Those colleges 
are:  Alabama  A&M  University,  Alabama  State  University,  Auburn  University,  Jacksonville  State  University,  University  of 
Montevallo, University of West Alabama, University of North Alabama, University of South Alabama, and Troy University.  The 
University of Alabama board of trustees is not controlled by the State, but the University is subject to budgetary control by the State. 
The Crimson Tide Foundation, the Southern Research Institute, UAB Research Foundation, and Triton Health Systems, L.L.C. are 
blended  component  units  of  the  University  of  Alabama,  therefore,  are  included  in  all  amounts  reported  for  the  University.    The 
University of South Alabama includes the Professional Liability Trust Fund, the General Liability Trust Fund, and the University of 
South Alabama HealthCare Management, LLC as blended component units. 
 
In addition to the blended component units, there are other legally separate, tax exempt organizations that are discretely presented 
component units of the universities.  These organizations generally exist to raise funds to benefit a specific university.  Although the 
university may not control the timing or amount of receipts from these foundations, the majority of resources that the foundations hold 
and invest are restricted to benefit the activities of the universities by the donors.  Because the resources are held for the benefit of the 
universities, the foundations are considered the discretely presented component units of the universities and are included in each of the 
universities’  financial  statements.    For  the  University  of  Alabama,  the  University’s  discretely  presented  component  units  are  The 
National  Alumni  Association  of  The  University  of  Alabama,  The  Capstone  Foundation,  The  1831  Foundation,  Capstone  Health

Authority is subject to full budgetary control.  The Authority has received no funding for a number of years and is currently inactive.  
 
The  Historical  Commission  is  responsible  for  the  preservation  of  historic  sites,  buildings,  and  objects.    The  twenty-member 
Commission is not controlled by the State, but the Commission's budget is subject to State control. 
 
The Choctawhatchee Pea and Yellow Rivers Watershed Management Authority develops and executes plans for water conservation 
and usage, flood control and prevention, water pollution control, wildlife habitat protection, and erosion control within the boundaries 
of the Authority.  The directors of the Authority are elected by local residents, but the Authority is subject to State budgetary control. 
 
The Agricultural Museum Board exists to preserve and exhibit agricultural artifacts.  The Board is not controlled by the State, but it is 
subject to State budgetary control. 
 
The Music Hall of Fame operates a public exhibit displaying music memorabilia in honor of Alabamians who have made a lasting 
contribution to music.  The Hall has both an independent board and is fiscally independent of the State.  The Hall is included in these 
financial statements because it would be misleading to exclude.  The State has some limited budgetary influence and the State funded 
the construction of the Hall's facilities with a general obligation bond issue. 
 
The Historic Blakeley Authority preserves the historic site of the town of Blakeley and operates a park on the site.  The Authority has 
both an independent board and is fiscally independent of the State.  The Authority is included in the reporting entity because the State 
has some limited budgetary influence and the State provides the majority of the Authority's funding. 
 
The Alabama Incentives Financing Authority was created to fulfill the State's financial commitments made to industries locating and 
expanding in the State under the terms of legislation granting certain financial incentives.  The Authority is made up of three state 
officials and is authorized to issue bonds to fulfill the State's financial commitments. 
 
The Revolving Loan Fund Authority was created to make grants to twelve regional planning commissions for the purpose of financing 
local economic development projects.  Four of the six members of the Authority are state officials. 
 
The  Alabama  Twenty-first  Century  Authority  was  created  to  promote  economic  development  and  industrial  recruitment.    The 
Authority can issue revenue bonds and pledge part of the proceeds of the settlement of the tobacco industry litigation to finance the 
bonds.  The Authority is made up of three state officials. 
 
The Agricultural Development Authority promotes development of agriculture in the State by making low interest loans available to 
persons  engaged  in  agricultural  operations.    The  seven-member  board  is  made  up  of  three  state  officials  and  four  other  persons 
appointed by the State. 
 
The Public Historical Sites and Parks Improvement Corporation renovates, improves, maintains, and constructs State owned public 
historical sites and parks not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources as well as non-State 
owned public historical sites and parks.  The six members of the Corporation are state officials. 
 
The  Red  Mountain  Greenway  and  Recreational  Area  Commission  is  responsible  for  preserving,  restoring,  and  promoting  as  a 
greenway, recreational area, or historic site certain land in Birmingham which played an important role in the steel industry of the 
State.    The fifteen member Commission is not controlled by the State, but the Commission is fiscally dependent on the State.   

4. Fiduciary Component Units 
Fiduciary component units are required by GAAP to be reported as fiduciary funds of the primary government rather than as discretely 
presented component units.  In accordance with GAAP, fiduciary funds and component units that are fiduciary in nature are excluded 
from the government-wide financial statements. 
 
The  Employees’  Retirement  System  (ERS),  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  operates  several  pension  (and  other  employee 
benefit) trust funds for the benefit of state and local governmental employees.  The ERS is governed by a thirteen-member board of 
control, seven of whom are either primary government officials or appointees of the Governor.

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
The  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (TRS),  a  discretely  presented  component  unit,  operates  a  pension  plan  for  the  benefit  of  all 
employees of public education institutions throughout the State.  It is governed by a fourteen-member board, ten of whom are elected 
from  among  the  member  employees.    The  administrative  budget  of  TRS  is  subject  to  approval  by  the  State.      Audited  financial 
statements for the TRS and ERS may be obtained from the RSA at 201 South Union Street, P.O. Box 302150, Montgomery, AL 
36130-2150.  

5. Excluded Organizations 
Other entities have been examined but failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the State's reporting entity.  City and county boards of 
education are legally separate organizations whose boards are not controlled by the State.  They are fiscally dependent on both the 
State and local government.  It is more appropriate that they be included in a local government's reporting entity. 
 
The  Elk  River  Development  Agency,  Bear  Creek  Development  Authority,  and  Cahaba  Trace  Commission  are  legally  separate 
organizations  whose  boards  are  not  controlled  by  the  State  nor  are  they  fiscally  dependent  on  the  State.    All  three  of  these 
organizations  are  excluded.    The  many  local  soil  and  water  conservation  districts  are  legally  separate  organizations  which  have 
independent boards and are fiscally independent.  In keeping with their independence, they are excluded from this report. 

6. Sources of Information 
The majority of state organizations, whether primary government or component unit, conduct their financial operations from the State 
Treasury through the State's central accounting system under the supervision and review of the State Comptroller, State Treasurer, and 
State Auditor.  The source of information on these agencies is the State's central accounting system.  For these agencies, the recording 
of cash, warrants payable, encumbrances, salaries payable, compensated absences, most investments, most short-term payables, most 
revenues, and most expenditures/expenses are controlled by the State Comptroller and/or the State Treasurer and are therefore subject 
to extensive scrutiny.  Accruals of revenues, a few accruals of expenditures/expenses, and all other accounts, such as depreciation, 
capital assets, inventories, and capital leases, generally are based on data provided by the individual agencies.  The data provided by 
the  agencies  are  reviewed  and  recorded  once  a  year  and  are  believed  to  be  materially  correct  even  though  they  are  not  generally 
subject to extensive scrutiny by the State Comptroller, State Treasurer, or State Auditor.   
 
There are some organizations and funds which meet the criteria for inclusion as part of the reporting entity even though they have the 
authority to conduct their financial operations through bank accounts and accounting systems outside the State Treasury, independent 
of the direct daily control of the State Comptroller, State Treasurer, and State Auditor.  These non-Treasury agencies are included in 
the financial statements based on information provided to the State Comptroller once a year by the agency or the agency's auditors.  
Whenever possible, the non-Treasury agencies are reported as they appeared in the information submitted to the State Comptroller.  
However, corrections or modifications have been made whenever required to comply with generally accepted accounting principles or 
wherever necessary to ensure consistent statewide report presentation.

B. Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 

1. Government-Wide Financial Statements 
Government-wide  financial  statements  include  two  basic  financial  statements:    the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  and  the  Statement  of 
Activities.  The two statements report the State’s governmental activities separately from its business-type activities.  Governmental 
activities generally are financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange revenues.  Business-type activities 
are  financed  in  whole  or  in  part  by  fees  charged  to  external  parties  for  goods  or  services.    Fiduciary  funds  and  fiduciary-type 
component units are excluded from the government-wide financial statements.  
 
The Statement of Net Assets presents the reporting entity’s non-fiduciary assets and liabilities, with the difference reported  as net 
assets.  Net Assets are reported in three categories: 
 
Invested in Capital Assets, Net of Related Debt consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by outstanding 
balances for bonds, notes, and other debt that are attributed to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. 
 
Restricted Net Assets result when constraints placed on net asset use are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, 
and the like, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 
 
Unrestricted Net Assets consist of net assets that do not meet the definition of the two preceding categories.   
 
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment is offset by program 
revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable within a specific function.  Program revenues include 1) charges to 
customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function and 2) 
grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function.  Taxes and other 
items not meeting the definition of program revenues are reported as general revenue. 

2. Fund Financial Statements 
Separate fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter 
are excluded from the government-wide statements.  Major individual governmental funds and major individual proprietary funds are 
reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements, with nonmajor funds being combined into a single column.

C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation  

1. Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting 
These financial statements are reported in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted 
on the face of the statement or in the Notes to the Financial Statements.  GAAP basis reporting differs considerably in some ways 
from the budgetary and cash basis accounting under which the State budgets and operates. 

a. Accrual Basis 
Under GAAP, the government-wide statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of 
accounting, as are the proprietary and fiduciary fund financial statements. Agency funds, however, do not have a measurement focus.  
Revenues  are  recognized  and  recorded  when  earned  and  expenses  are  recorded  when  a  liability  is  incurred  for  exchange  and 
exchange-like  transactions,  regardless  of  the  timing  of  cash  flows.    For  nonexchange  transactions,  revenues  and  expenditures  and 
related  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  as  required  by  GASB  Statement  No.  33.    For  derived  nonexchange  transactions, 
receivables  and  revenues  are  recognized  when  the  underlying  exchange  has  occurred.    For  imposed  nonexchange  transactions, 
receivables are recognized when an enforceable legal claim has arisen.  Revenues are recognized when resources are required to be 
used or the first period that use is permitted. 
 
Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied.  For government mandated nonexchange revenues 
such as grants, GAAP require the recognition of assets, revenues, liabilities, and expenditures when all eligibility requirements have 
been met and (for revenues) resources are available.  Agency funds, fiduciary in nature, do not recognize revenues and expenditures. 
 
The State has elected to exercise paragraph 6 of GASB Statement No. 20, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Proprietary Funds 
and Other Governmental Entities That Use Proprietary Fund Accounting."  Statement No. 20, paragraph 6, requires that all proprietary 
activities  should  apply  all  applicable  GASB  pronouncements  as  well  as  any  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB) 
Statements  and  Interpretations,  Accounting  Principles  Board  (APB)  Opinions,  and  Accounting  Research  Bulletins  (ARBs)  of  the 
Committee  on  Accounting  Procedure  (CAP)  issued  on  or  before  November  30,  1989,  unless  such  FASB,  APB,  and  CAP 
pronouncements conflict with or contradict GASB pronouncements.  FASB pronouncements issued after November 30, 1989, even if 
they modify an applicable FASB, APB, or CAP pronouncement, are not applicable unless adopted by a GASB pronouncement. 

b. Modified Accrual Basis 
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual 
basis of accounting.  Under this focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet.  Revenues 
are  recognized  as  they  become  susceptible  to  accrual;  generally  when  they  are  both  measurable  and  available.    Revenues  are 
considered to be available when they are collected within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current 
period.  For this purpose, the State generally considers tax revenues and court settlements to be available if they are collected within 
sixty days of the end of the fiscal period.  Revenues that the State earns by incurring obligations are recognized in the period when all 
applicable eligibility requirements have been met and the resources are available.  The State considers revenues earned by incurring 
obligations to be available if they are collected within sixty days of the end of the fiscal period.  Expenditures generally are recorded 
when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.  However, expenditures related to debt service, compensated absences, and 
claims and judgments are recorded only when payment is due and payable. 
 
Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, recognition criteria are different for exchange and nonexchange transactions.  For 
exchange and exchange-like transactions, revenues and related current assets are recognized when measurable and available to finance 
operations  during  the  year  or  if  available  to  liquidate  liabilities  existing  at  the  end  of  the  year.    Therefore,  in  governmental  fund 
financial statements, revenues and the resulting assets are accrued at year-end only if the revenues are earned and the receivables are 
expected to be collected in time to pay for liabilities in existence at the end of the period.  Expenditures are recognized when the 
related fund liability is incurred, except for items that are not expected to be liquidated with expendable available resources, such as 
the  long-term  portion  of  compensated  absences  payable  and  capital  lease  obligations.    Therefore,  expenditures  and  the  related 
liabilities are accrued at year-end only when they are normally payable from current expendable funds.  In order to determine which 
revenues should be accrued, an arbitrary time limit is established.  Revenues are recognized when measurable and available.  The 
State uses sixty days after fiscal year end as the time limit for the accrual of revenues.  For nonexchange transactions, revenues and 
expenditures and related assets and liabilities are recognized as required by GASB Statement No. 33.  For income taxes, general sales 
taxes, utility taxes, insurance premium taxes, general use taxes, gasoline taxes, motor fuels tax, electric public utility tax, and other 
derived  nonexchange  transactions,  receivables  and  revenues  are  recognized  when  the  underlying  exchange  has  occurred  and  the 
resources  are  available.    For  property  taxes,  business  privilege  tax,  and  other  imposed  nonexchange  transactions,  receivables  are 
recognized when an enforceable legal claim has arisen.  Revenues are recognized when resources are required to be used or the first 
period that use is permitted and the resources are available.  For property taxes, revenues are recognized if received within sixty days; 
 

65

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
otherwise,  deferred  revenue  is  recognized.    For  federal  grants  and  other  government  mandated  nonexchange  revenues,  assets, 
revenues, liabilities, and expenditures are recognized when all eligibility requirements have been met and (for revenues) resources are 
available.  For reimbursement-type federal grants, eligibility requirements are met when recipients incur allowable costs, not when 
those costs are submitted for reimbursement. 
 
Material accruals are for income taxes, general sales taxes, utility taxes, insurance premium taxes, general use taxes, gasoline taxes, 
motor fuels tax, electric public utilities tax, property taxes, business privilege tax, nursing facility tax, pharmaceutical services tax, 
federal grants, oil and gas royalties, investment sales receivables, and interest.   

2. Financial Statement Presentation 

a. Major Funds 
The State reports six major governmental funds. The General Fund is the State’s primary operating fund.  It is used to account for 
and  report  all  financial  resources  not  accounted  for  and  reported  in  another  fund.    The  Education  Trust  Fund  accounts  for  the 
revenues collected for the support,  maintenance, and development of public education in Alabama.  General sales and uses taxes, 
income taxes, and utilities taxes are the primary revenues restricted to this fund.  The Alabama Trust Fund consists of income from 
the sale or lease of rights for offshore exploration and drilling for oil and gas off the Alabama coast.  Investment income earned on the 
trust  balance  is  used  to  support  the  General  Fund,  Forever  Wild  Land  Trust,  and  a  variety  of  capital  projects  and  debt  service.  
Medicaid accounts for the portion of the Medicaid program that is funded by Federal revenues and Medicaid provider taxes. The 
Public Road and Bridge Fund accounts for highway construction, maintenance, and operations. Revenues in the fund consist of 
federal revenues, gasoline taxes, and other motor fuel taxes.  The Public Welfare Trust Fund accounts for the administration of a 
broad range of social and protective services programs that provide financial assistance to individuals.  Revenues restricted to the fund 
include federal revenues, property taxes, and liquor and wine taxes. 
 
The State reports four major enterprise funds.  The Unemployment Compensation Trust accounts for the activities of the federal 
unemployment insurance program including employer contributions, Federal Unemployment Trust advances, and benefit claims to the 
unemployed.  The State Port Authority was created to engage in promoting, developing, constructing, maintaining, and operating 
harbors, seaports, and river ports within the State of Alabama.  The Alabama Community College System accounts for the revenues 
and expenses of the State’s Community and Technical Colleges, Athens State University, the Alabama Industrial Development and 
Training  Institute,  the  Alabama  Technology  Network,  the  Alabama  Fire  College,  and  Marion  Military  Institute.    The  Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Board was created to control alcoholic beverages through distribution, licensing, and enforcement.   

b. Nonmajor Funds 
The State reports a number of nonmajor governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds.   
 
Governmental Fund Types: 
Special Revenue Funds account for the proceeds of specific revenue resources that are restricted or committed to specified purposes 
other than debt service or capital projects.  Examples include public health, education, and corrections.   
 
Debt Service Funds account for financial resources that are restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for governmental debt 
principal and interest.   
 
Capital Projects Funds account for financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditures for the acquisition, 
construction, and improvement of major general governmental capital assets.     
 
Permanent Funds account for resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for 
purposes that benefit the government or its citizenry. 
 
Proprietary Fund Types: 
Enterprise Funds report the activities for which fees are charged to external users for goods or services such as health insurance. 
 
Internal Service Funds provide goods or services primarily to other agencies or funds of the State, rather than to the general public.  
Examples include information technology, telecommunications, office building rentals, and the State Motor Pool.  In the government-
wide  statements,  internal  service  funds  are  included  with  governmental  activities.    Eliminations  have  been  made  to  minimize  the 
double counting of internal activity, including internal service fund type activity on the government-wide financial statements. 
 
 
 

 
66 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiduciary Fund Types: 
Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Funds account for resources that are required to be held in trust for the  members and 
beneficiaries  of  the  State’s  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  deferred  compensation  plan,  individual  retirement  accounts,  post-
employment  health  care  plans,  and  flexible  employees’  benefit  plans.    The  defined  benefit  pension  plans  include  plans  for  state 
employees, state police, some city and county employees, teachers, judges, peace officers, state dock employees, and circuit clerks of 
the courts. 
 
Private Purpose Trust Funds account for resources of all other trust arrangements in which principal and income benefit individuals, 
private organizations, or other governments.  The State’s largest private purpose funds are education related for either college tuition 
benefits or local public schools.  There are five endowment funds established by private citizens that the State manages as trustee for 
local school systems and reports as Local Education Endowments.  The Foundation for Local Schools was established so that the 
Retirement Systems of Alabama can use its investing expertise to get maximum return on investments for numerous small local school 
foundations and trusts.   
 
Agency Funds report assets and liabilities for deposits and investments entrusted to the State as an agent for others.  The State has 
agency funds that account for some taxes collected, payroll withholdings, child support payments, cash bonds, and other purposes. 

D. Fiscal Year 
The State fiscal year ends on September 30.  One component unit, the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission, has the power to 
set its own fiscal year (Code of Alabama 1975, Section 41-10-307, as amended).  The Commission has set its fiscal year to end on the 
last Sunday in September in order to coordinate its accounting period with the weekly cycle of campers.  The Commission's fiscal year 
for 2011 ended on September 25.  The difference in fiscal years had no material effect on the financial statements. 

E. Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets and Fund Balances 

1. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, as reported on the financial statements (the government-wide and the fund financial statements), are under 
the control of the State Treasurer or other administrative bodies as determined by law.  The cash in all funds operating from the State 
Treasury is pooled as treasury cash and invested by the State Treasurer.  The State Treasurer has statutory authority to invest treasury 
cash in demand accounts or time deposit-open accounts with any qualified public depository.  The State Treasurer can also invest up 
to twenty percent of treasury cash in securities and obligations of the U.S. Treasury or federal agencies for a period of time that may 
exceed  one  year.    All  of  the  cash  and  investments  in  the  State  Treasury  cash  management  pool  are  reported  as  cash  and  cash 
equivalents  because  the  pool  is  used  essentially  as  a  demand  deposit  account.      Commercial  paper  is  reported  as  an  investment 
regardless of the original maturity date.  For funds operating outside the State Treasury, cash and cash equivalents generally include 
demand deposit accounts, petty cash accounts, and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less 
when purchased. 

2. Receivables 
In the government-wide and governmental fund financial statements, the largest receivables are amounts accrued for income taxes, 
general sales taxes, utility taxes, insurance premium taxes, general use taxes, and property taxes as required by GASB Statement No. 
33.   
 
The second largest receivables are amounts due from other governments, consisting almost entirely of grants and reimbursements due 
from the federal government where collectability is reasonably assured.  Accordingly, no allowance for uncollectible accounts has 
been established.  Amounts due from local governments are not a significant portion of amounts due from other governments. 
 
The property tax calendar for the State is simple.  The levy date, the assessment date, and the lien date are all the same date – October 
1.  On October 1, the assessed value of all property is multiplied by the applicable rates to levy the property tax.  On that date, the 
State has a lien (a legal claim) against the property.  The property tax is not due until October 1 the following year.  The property tax 
is paid in arrears between October 1 and December 31.  After December 31, it is delinquent. 
 
The  most  significant  Accounts  Receivable  is  recorded  in  the  Alabama  Trust  Fund  for  oil  and  gas  royalties  earned  on  natural  gas 
produced  in  Alabama’s  offshore  waters.  The  primary  government  has  minimal  amounts  of  Notes  and  Loans  Receivable,  as  such 
agreements would constitute an illegal extension of credit by the State for any fund operating from the State Treasury.  Interest and 

 

67 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
Dividends Receivable includes amounts earned on investments, notes, mortgages, and loans receivable. Investment Sales Receivable 
consists of amounts receivable for investments sold but the transaction was not settled before year-end. 
 
For component units, the largest portion of Mortgages, Notes, and Loans Receivable consists of loans made by the Alabama Housing 
Finance  Authority.    The  mortgage  loans  of  the  Authority  are  carried  at  their unpaid principal balances  less  an allowance for  loan 
losses.  Also included in this category are student loans owed to various Universities.  The loans are reported net of an allowance for 
uncollectible loans.   
 
Due from Other Governments as reported for the component units consists almost entirely of amounts owed by local governments.  
Most  of  the  amount  consists  of  loans  made  by  the  Alabama  Water  Pollution  Control  Authority  and  the  Drinking  Water  Finance 
Authority.  Accounts Receivable as reported for the component units are comprised primarily of amounts owed to colleges. 

3. Interfund Activity and Balances 
Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are reported 
as either Due To Other Funds or Due From Other Funds.  Any residual balances outstanding between the governmental activities and 
business-type  activities  are  reported  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements  as  Internal  Balances.  Receivables  and  payables 
involving fiduciary funds are presented as accounts payable or receivable on the government-wide Statement of Net Assets. 
 
Eliminations have been made to minimize the double-counting of internal activity, including internal service fund type activity on the 
government-wide financial statements.  However, interfund services, provided and used between different functions, have not been 
eliminated in order to avoid distorting the direct costs and program revenues of the applicable functions.  Operating transfers between 
governmental and business-type activities are reported at the net amount on the government-wide financial statements. 
 
In the fund financial statements, transactions for services rendered by one fund to another are treated as revenues of the recipient fund 
and  expenditures/expenses  of  the  disbursing  fund.    Reimbursements  of  expenditures/expenses  made  by  one  fund  for  another  are 
recorded  as  expenditures/expenses  in  the  reimbursing  fund  and  as  a  reduction  of  expenditures/expenses  in  the  reimbursed  fund.  
Transfers represent flows of assets between funds of the primary government without equivalent flows of assets in return and without 
a requirement for payment. 

4. Inventories 
Inventories of supplies in governmental fund financial statements are reported at cost using the purchases method.  An inventory asset 
account  is  reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with  an  offset  to  Nonspendable  Fund  Balance.    Inventories  of  materials  and  supplies  on 
proprietary fund financial statements are determined by both physical counts and through perpetual inventory systems and are valued 
at the lower of cost or market.  Valuation methods used on the proprietary and governmental fund financial statements include first-in 
first-out, average cost, weighted average, and retail inventory method.  

5. Investments 
Investments as reported on the Statement of Net Assets include long-term investments.  As required by GASB Statement No. 31, 
“Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for External Investment Pools”, most investments are recorded at 
fair value.  Securities traded on national or international exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates.  
Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.  Mortgage-backed securities are reported based on future 
principal and interest payments discounted at the current interest rate for similar instruments.  The fair value of real estate investments 
held by pension plans and endowments is based on independent appraisals. Real estate investments held by Risk Management, an 
internal  service  fund,  are  reported  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  less  an  allowance  for  any  impairment  in  value.  No 
investments are recorded at amortized cost. 

6. Restricted Assets 
Assets  required  to  be  held  and/or  used  as  specified  in  bond  covenants,  other  debt  agreements,  donor  specifications,  and  court 
settlements have been recorded as "Restricted Assets."  These assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury 
obligations and certificates of deposit. 

7. Capital Assets 
Capital assets, which include buildings, land, equipment, intangibles, and infrastructure (e.g., roads and bridges), are reported in the 
applicable  governmental  or  business-type  activities  columns  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.    Most  capital  assets  are 
defined by the State as assets with an initial cost of at least $5,000 and have initial useful lives extending beyond a single reporting 
period.  Software and other intangibles must have an initial cost of at least $100,000.  Capitalized assets are recorded at historical cost 
or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed.  Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value at the date 
of donation.  The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend assets lives are

not  capitalized.    Major  outlays  for  capital  assets  and  improvements  are  capitalized  as  projects  are  constructed.    Capital  assets  are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: 
 
Assets 
 
 
Buildings 
 
Improvements Other than Buildings  
 
Equipment 
Software 
 
 
Land, infrastructure, construction in progress and historical artifacts are not depreciated.  The State has elected to apply the modified 
approach to accounting for infrastructure (e.g., roadways, bridges, and tunnels).  Under this approach, the infrastructure assets are not 
depreciated  because  the  State  is  committed  to  maintaining  the  assets  at  a  minimum  condition  level  that  the  Department  of 
Transportation (ALDOT) has determined to be adequate to meet the needs of the citizens.  Costs for maintenance and preservation are 
expensed  in  the  period  incurred.    Additions  and  improvements  are  capitalized.    The  ALDOT  maintains  an  inventory  of  all 
infrastructure assets and performs regular condition assessments of those assets to establish that they are in fact being maintained at or 
above the condition level established.  ALDOT also makes an annual estimate of the cost necessary to maintain and preserve those 
infrastructure assets at the target condition level.  The cost of infrastructure reported includes historical costs from 1980 to the present 
as required by GASB Statement No. 34 as well as historical costs preceding 1980.     
 
Extensive project documentation is required to meet various Federal and State guidelines concerning the construction of infrastructure.  
The  completeness  of  this  documentation  affects  the  timing  of  project  capitalization.    The  State  capitalizes  road  and  bridge 
infrastructure annually when all costs for a project are incurred and all project documentation is satisfactorily completed, filed and 
accepted with the appropriate entities.  Projects that meet the cost and documentation criteria are closed and appropriate entries are 
made  to  adjust  the  Infrastructure  Construction  in  Progress  and  Infrastructure  asset  accounts  annually.    Due  to  the  documentation 
requirements, there can be substantial time lags between the date a project is put into service on the State’s roadway network and the 
date the project is capitalized.  A significant portion of Infrastructure Construction in Progress consists of projects that have been put 
into service and maintenance costs could have been incurred. 

8. Compensated Absences 
Employees in permanent positions accrue annual leave at a rate of four hours and twenty minutes to nine hours and forty-five minutes 
semi-monthly,  depending  upon  their  length  of  service.    Upon  separation  from  service,  an  eligible  employee  is  paid  for  the  actual 
number of annual leave days he has earned, up to a maximum of sixty days, with the amount being computed on the basis of his daily 
pay rate at time of separation multiplied by the number of days leave due. 
 
Sick leave is accrued at a rate of four hours and twenty minutes semi-monthly.  Employees may accumulate up to a maximum of 150 
days sick leave.  Employees may be compensated for one-half of the maximum accrued sick leave only upon retirement from state 
service.  The employee must have twenty-five years of service or have attained the age of 60 and have ten years of service to be 
eligible to retire.  State Troopers must have twenty-five years of service or have attained the age of 52 and have ten years of service to 
be eligible to retire.  If a state employee in the classified service dies while in active service to the State, the estate of the deceased 
employee receives a payment of fifty percent of the accrued and unused sick leave, not to exceed 600 hours, which the employee was 
credited with at the time of his or her death. 
 
The monetary value of accumulated annual and sick leave payable upon termination or retirement is included in the government-wide 
statement  of  net  assets,  proprietary  fund  financial  statements,  and  fiduciary  fund  financial  statements.    In  the  governmental  fund 
financial  statements,  amounts  reported  are  for  unused,  matured  leave  amounts  payable  to  employees  whose  employment  was 
terminated by September 30.  These amounts are paid to the employees during the first month after the end of the fiscal year so those 
actual payments were used to compute the amount payable.  Amounts not payable from expendable available resources (long-term 
liabilities) are reported in the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.   
 
The liability for compensated absences was computed using salary rates effective at fiscal year end including the employer's share of 
social security and Medicare taxes payable and represents annual and sick leave earned up to the allowable ceilings.  The sick leave is 
calculated separately for vested and non-vested employees.  Sick leave is subjected to an actuarially determined probability multiplier 
that the employee will remain to retire and collect sick leave.  The probability multipliers are as follows: 
 

Public Education Employees 
State Employees

9. Long-Term Obligations 
Long-term  debt  is  recognized  as  a  liability  in  governmental  fund  financial  statements  when  due,  or  when  resources  have  been 
accumulated  in  the  debt  service  fund  for payment  early  in  the  following  year.    For  other  long-term  obligations,  only  that  portion 
expected  to  be  financed  from  expendable  available  financial  resources  is  reported  as  a  liability  in  governmental  fund  financial 
statements.  The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the government-wide financial statements.  Long-term liabilities 
expected to be financed from proprietary fund operations are accounted for in those funds in the proprietary fund financial statements. 

10. Net Assets and Fund Balances  
As  discussed previously,  net  assets  on  the  government-wide  financial  statements  and  the  proprietary  fund financial  statements  are 
reported in three categories: (1) invested in capital assets, net of related debt; (2) restricted net assets; and (3) unrestricted net assets.   
 
Fund balances reported in the governmental fund financial statements are classified as nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, 
or unassigned.   Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either 1) not in spendable form, 
such as inventory and long term receivables; or 2) legally and contractually required to be maintained intact, such as the principal of a 
permanent fund.  Restricted fund balances have constraints placed on the use of the resources that are either 1) externally imposed by 
creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws of other governments or 2) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling 
legislation.  Committed fund balances include amounts constrained by formal action of the State’s highest decision-making authority.  
The  authorization  should  have  the  consent  of  both  the  legislative  and  executive  branches  of  government.    Commitments  may  be 
changed or lifted only through an equivalent formal high level action.  Commitments are not considered to be legally enforceable by 
an external party.  External parties such as citizens or the judiciary can compel the State through legal action to honor restrictions but 
not  commitments.    Assigned  fund  balances  are  amounts  that  are  constrained  by  the  government’s  intent  to  be  used  for  specific 
purposes.    Assigned  fund  balances  include  1)  all  remaining  non-negative  amounts  reported  in  governmental  funds  other  than  the 
General Fund and 2) amounts in the General Fund that are constrained by the State’s intent to be used for a specific purpose, but are 
neither restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the State legislature or by its delegation to a State official such as an agency 
head or the Finance Director.  Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification and only the General Fund can report a positive 
unassigned fund balance.  Negative unassigned fund balance can be reported in any governmental fund if expenditures incurred for 
specific purposes exceeded the amount restricted, committed or assigned to those purposes. 
 
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is available, it is the State’s 
policy  to  spend  unrestricted  fund  balance  before  restricted.    Unrestricted  fund  balance  is  considered  spent  in  the  following  order: 
unassigned, assigned, committed. 

F. Proprietary Fund Operating Revenues and Expenses 
Proprietary funds report operating revenues and expenses separately from non-operating items.  Operating items generally result from 
producing  and  delivering  goods  and  services  that  are  a  normal  part  of  the  primary  business  of  the  fund.    Operating  expenses  for 
enterprise funds and internal service funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on capital 
assets.  Revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues and expenses. 

G. New Accounting Pronouncements 
During the current fiscal year, the State implemented the following new accounting pronouncements: 
  GASB Statement No. 54:  Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions 
  GASB Statement No. 59:  Financial Instruments Omnibus

NOTE 2 - FUND BALANCES/NET ASSETS 

A. Restricted Net Assets 
The Government-wide Statement of Net Assets reports $5.0 billion of restricted net assets for the primary government, of which $183 
million is restricted by enabling legislation. 

B. Restatements 
Fund Balances and Net Assets as of October 1, 2010 have been restated for prior period adjustments necessary to conform to GAAP.  
The General Fund was restated $1,779,000 for interest receivable not recorded in the prior year.  The Public Road and Bridge Fund 
was restated $9,726,000 for an overstatement of amounts held.  Corrections Institute Finance Authority, a nonmajor debt service fund, 
was restated $(117,000) because cash was overstated.  
 
The  Service  Division  Fund,  an  Internal  Service  Fund,  was  restated  by  $(150,000)  primarily  because  capital  asset  accumulated 
depreciation was understated.   
 
On the government-wide financial statements, beginning net assets for governmental activities were restated from $22,611,014,000 to 
$22,630,048,000,  an  increase  of  $19,034,000.    Included  in  this  restatement  was  $993,000  for  interest  receivable,  $(4,976,000)  in 
governmental  long-term  debt  restatements  for  capital  leases  which  were  not  reported  in  the  previous  year  and  $11,778,000  in 
restatements of governmental capital assets.    
 
Net assets for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board were restated $250,000 because a payable was overstated.   
 
The Flexible Employees’ Benefits Board, a fiduciary fund, was restated by $206,000 for employee benefit costs overstated in the prior 
year.  The Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust Fund, a fiduciary fund, was restated $3,483,000 because Medicare Part D 
revenues were understated. 
 
The  Alabama  Public  School  and  College  Authority,  a  major  component  unit,  was  restated  $(38,803,000)  because  grants  were 
erroneously reported as loans receivable in the prior year.  
 
Mental Health, a major component unit, was restated for capital assets by $(7,000). 
  
Auburn University, a major component unit, was restated by $24,222,000 primarily from an underreporting of prepaid expense.     
 
Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, a nonmajor component unit, was restated by $(2,216,000), which was the net effect 
of increases in allowances for student receivables, accrued interest on bonds payable, and accrued expenses.   
 
Alabama State University was restated by $(2,861,000), primarily from the recording of derivatives liabilities not previously reported.  

Among  other  nonmajor  component  units,  Miscellaneous  Nonmajor  Component  Units  were  restated  by  $(10,000),  the  Historical 
Commission had capital asset restatements of $996,000, and Red Mountain Recreation Commission had a capital asset restatement of 
$52,000. 

C. Fund Balance/Net Assets Deficits 

1. Primary Government 
 
The General Fund, a major governmental fund, had a deficit in unassigned fund balance of $24,796,000, and a total fund balance 
deficit of $20,150,000.  The fund owes the Alabama Trust Fund $161.6 million that was borrowed from the Rainy Day Trust Account 
in fiscal year 2009 under the provisions of Amendment 803 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
The Education Trust Fund, a major governmental fund, had a deficit in unassigned fund balance of $203,095,000.   The fund owes the 
Alabama Trust Fund $437.4 million that was borrowed from the Rainy Day Trust Account in fiscal year 2009 under the provisions of 
Amendment 803 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.   
 
The Medicaid Fund, a major governmental fund, had a deficit unassigned fund balance of $82,418,000.  The deficit is the result of the 
accrual of claims outstanding at September 30, 2011.  The expense is recognized in fiscal year 2011 along with a receivable for the 
federal share of the claims.  The State matching money will not be available until fiscal year 2012 when the claims are paid. 
 
The Unemployment Compensation Trust, a major proprietary fund, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $32,876,000.  The deficit 
is the result of a $44,189,000 advance from the Federal Government which is included in “Due to Other Governments.” 
 
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, a major proprietary fund, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $21,618,000, with a total 
net asset deficit of $19,251,000.  The deficits are largely due to the accrual of liabilities for compensated absences, salaries payable, 
other post-employment benefits, and profits currently due to other funds.  The Board, by law, operates on a cash basis and is required 
to distribute 100 percent of its profits as transfers to other funds.  
 
The Building Renovation Finance Authority, an internal service fund, had a deficit balance of $3,764,000 in net assets invested in 
capital assets, net of related debt. The fund’s major assets are buildings, which have depreciated values that are less than the principal 
remaining on the long-term debt associated with them. The fund had overall positive net assets of $17,441,000. 
 
The Flexible Employees’ Benefits Board, an Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund, had deficit net assets of $1,201,000. The Board 
owes a note payable to the State Employees’ Insurance Board,, a major component unit, in the amount of $1,000,000.  The Board also 
has liabilities to employees for health care and dependent care reimbursements.  The fund does not break even on those liabilities until 
the end of December because benefits are paid out on a calendar year basis. 

2. Component Units 
 
The Public School and College Authority, a major component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $2,245,482,000 causing a 
deficit in total net assets of $2,213,008,000.  The Authority issues bonds to raise money for grants which are made primarily to local 
school systems for the construction and improvement of educational buildings owned by those systems.  The bonds will be repaid with 
future tax revenues pledged by the primary government. 
 
Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, a nonmajor component unit, has a deficit of $7,541,000 in unrestricted net assets, 
but overall net assets are a positive $77,411,000.   
 
The  Space  Science  Exhibit  Commission,  a  nonmajor  component  unit,  had  a  deficit  in  unrestricted  net  assets  of  $8,172,000  and 
positive overall net assets of $33,119,000.  Nearly all of the Commission’s assets are either restricted or capital assets.    
 
The Incentives Finance Authority, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $126,271,000 with an overall 
deficit in total net assets of $83,614,000.  The Authority issues bonds to raise money to fund commitments for economic development 
grants to industries relocating to Alabama and therefore the Authority accumulates few assets.  The resources to pay the debt will 
come from future tax revenues pledged by the primary government. 
 
The Twenty-first Century Authority, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $9,960,000 but an overall 
positive total net assets of $15,842,000.  The Authority issues bonds to raise money to fund commitments for economic development 
grants to industries relocating to Alabama and therefore the Authority accumulates few assets.  The resources to pay the debt will 
come from future tax revenues pledged by the primary government. 
 
The Revolving Loan Fund Authority, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets and in total net assets of 
$20,156,000.  The Authority issues bonds for making grants to Regional Planning and Development Commissions to be utilized as 
revolving  loans  by  the  grantees.    The  resources  to  repay  the  debt  will  come  from  future  tax  revenues  pledged  by  the  primary 
government.

NOTE 3 - ASSETS  

A. Cash Deposits 
The  State  Treasurer  has  statutory  authority  to  deposit  treasury  cash  in  demand  accounts  or  time  deposit-open  accounts  with  any 
qualified public depository.  The State Treasurer may also invest up to twenty percent of treasury cash in securities and obligations of 
the U.S. Treasury or federal agencies for a period of time that may exceed one year.  Funds may also be invested in obligations of the 
United States or its agencies under a repurchase agreement for a shorter period of time than the maturity date of the security.  
 
Deposits of both the primary government and its component units are entirely insured by Federal depository insurance or protected 
under the Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement (SAFE) Program.  The Code of Alabama 1975, as amended, requires all State 
organizations, including component units, to participate in the SAFE Program.  The SAFE Program is a multiple financial institution 
collateral  pool.    The  SAFE  Program  requires  State  treasury  cash  to  be  deposited  in  a  financial  institution  designated  by  the  State 
Treasurer as a qualified public depository.  Each qualified public depository is required to pledge collateral in accordance with the 
rules established by the SAFE Board of Directors.  In the event that a qualified public depository defaults or becomes insolvent and 
the  pledged  collateral  is  insufficient  to  satisfy  the  claims  of  public  depositors,  the  Code  of  Alabama  1975,  Section  41-14A-9(3) 
authorizes the State Treasurer to make assessments against the other qualified public depositories in the pool so that there will be no 
loss of public funds.  Also, all other public funds not managed by the State Treasurer are required to be deposited in a qualified public 
depository or placed through a qualified public depository which arranges for the funds to be deposited in federally insured banks or 
savings  associations  so  that  the  funds  and  accrued  interest  earned  on  them  are  fully  insured  by  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance 
Corporation and, at the same time, the qualified public depository receives or is credited with deposits from other banks or savings 
associations in an amount equal to or greater than the amount it arranged to be deposited in other banks and savings associations. 

B. Investments 
Investments are made in accordance with the statutes creating the various agencies of the State of Alabama.  The following describes 
the investments made by the major investing agencies of the State: 
 

1. Primary Government 
State Treasurer - The State Treasurer may legally invest state funds in obligations of the U.S. Treasury, Federal Land Bank bonds, 
Federal Home Loan Bank notes and bonds, Federal National Mortgage Association notes, and debentures or obligations guaranteed by 
the U.S. government. Investments in obligations of the United States or its agencies under a repurchase agreement are allowed.  The 
State Treasurer may also invest in money market mutual funds which invest solely in U.S. government or U.S. government agency 
securities.  
 
Alabama Trust Fund – Investments are limited to those authorized by law for the Retirement Systems of Alabama. The investments 
authorized for the Retirement Systems are described later in this section. 
 
Prepaid Affordable College Tuition (PACT) Program - The State is responsible for the management of the investments of the PACT 
program, although the investments are not property of the State. The funds may be invested in any instrument, obligation, security or 
property  that  constitutes  legal  investments  for  investment  of  public  funds  in  the  State,  including  legal  investments  of  the  State 
Treasurer and the Alabama Trust Fund that are deemed most appropriate by the PACT Board. 
 
Alabama  College  Education  Savings  (ACES)  Plan  –  The  Board  of  Trustees  administers  the program.    The  Board  of  Trustees has 
entered into a contract with UBT 529 Fund Services (Union Bank), a division of Union Bank and Trust Company.  Union Bank is the 
Program  Manager  and  the  Board  of  Trustees  has  delegated  day  to  day  administration  to  the  State  Treasurer.    The  investment 
alternatives are made available through investment portfolios each of which represents a separate, segregated portfolio of investments 
in mutual funds.    

2. Fiduciary Funds 
Retirement  Systems  of  Alabama  (RSA)  -  The  RSA  administers  the  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (TRS),  Employees’  Retirement 
System (ERS), and Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF).  RSA may invest in any types of investments that the Board of Control of each 
individual system approves.  Each Board is limited only by the "Prudent Man Rule" which requires it to use due care, skill, prudence, 
and diligence under the prevailing circumstances that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use 
in investing.

any agreement to repurchase any of the foregoing, or any combination thereof.  Each of the trust indentures established under the 
Authority's mortgage revenue bond programs contain further restrictions on the investment of non-expended bond proceeds; however, 
each  trust  indenture  must  be  consistent  with  the  Authority's  authorizing  legislation  with  respect  to  the  definition  of  eligible 
investments.    The  Authority's  program  investments  consist  of  Government  National  Mortgage  Association  (GNMA)  or  Federal 
National  Mortgage  Association  (FNMA)  pass-through  certificates,  all  of  which  are  pledged  as  security  for  the  mortgage  revenue 
bonds.   
 
Other investments include temporary and debt service reserve funds established under the provisions of various trust indentures, and 
investments of the Authority's general and housing assistance funds. 
 
Investments Made by Colleges and Universities - The colleges and universities invest funds in accordance with the applicable limits 
set forth in the gift instruments, Board of Trustees guidelines, or other applicable laws.  Certain bond indentures require that the bond 
funds invest all amounts in federal securities or eligible certificates.  In accordance with GASB Statement No. 31, most investments 
are stated at fair value.

C. Investment Risks 

1. Credit Risk 
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  an  issuer  or  other  counterparty  to  an  investment  will  not  fulfill  its  obligations.    Nationally  recognized 
statistical rating organizations provide ratings of debt securities quality based on a variety of factors, such as the financial condition of 
the issuers, which provide investors with some idea of the issuer’s ability to meet its obligations.

§  U S Govt rated Aaa (Moody's) and AA+ (Standard & Poor's)
† Consists primarily of private placements and bond mutual funds that are not rated.

The  investment  policy  for  the  State  Treasurer  was  mentioned  earlier.  The  investments  allowed  are  U.S.  government  or  agency 
securities, repurchase agreements backed by U.S government or U.S. government agency securities, or mutual funds investing in U.S 
government  or  U.S.  government  agency  securities.  The  U.S.  government  and  U.S.  government  agency  securities  are  rated  Aaa  or 
AA+.  Bond mutual funds may or may not be rated.   
 
As  mentioned  earlier  the  investments  of  the  Alabama  Trust  Fund  are  limited  to  those  authorized  for  the  Retirement  Systems  of 
Alabama. Domestic fixed-maturity investments may consist of rated or non-rated securities. International fixed-maturity investments 
may consist of securities with a rating of at least A by one of the principal rating agencies at the time of purchase or acquisition, 
except that up to 2% of the fair value of each System’s total portfolio may be invested in obligations of sovereign countries with a 
rating of BBB or BAA at the time of purchase.  The Systems may hedge against the possible adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
on each System’s portfolio of international fixed income obligations when it is considered appropriate.  Short-term investments may 
consist of commercial paper rated at least A-2 and/or P-2, repurchase agreements, short-term U.S. securities, and other money market 
investments.  

2. Interest Rate Risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates of debt investments will adversely affect the fair value of those investments. 
The Treasurer’s Office policy states that the maximum effective maturity of any purchase will be five years.  Market accepted average 
life at time of purchase shall be used in lieu of final maturity for the purpose of maturity acceptability of mortgage-backed securities.  
Average effective duration should be plus or minus 30% of the index duration.  The portfolio is benchmarked against the Barclays 
Capital 1 - 3 Year Government Index. 
 
The fair value of fixed-maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates.  Increases in prevailing interest 
rates generally translate into decreases in fair value of those instruments.  The fair value of interest sensitive instruments may also be 
affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market 
conditions.  Certain fixed maturity investments have call provisions that could result in shorter maturity periods.  
 
The investment policy of the Alabama Trust Fund states that the portfolio’s average duration is not to exceed 1.5 times that of the 
benchmark index. 
 
As of September 30, 2011 the State had the following investments and maturities:

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
The University of Alabama discloses the interest rate risk for the System Pool using the effective duration method.  The prices of fixed 
income securities with a longer time to maturity, measured by effective duration, tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
and, therefore, more volatile than those with shorter durations.  Effective duration is the approximate change in price of a security 
resulting from a 100 basis point (1 percentage point) change in the level of interest rates.  It is not a measure of time.  The University 
does not have a specific policy relative to interest rate risk.

3. Foreign Currency Risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The investment 
policy of the Alabama Trust Fund states that the exposure to emerging market securities shall be limited to 20% of the market value of 
the international portfolio.  Not more than 5% of the total stock portfolio may be invested in the common stock of any one corporation 
at the time of purchase and no more than 7% in any one corporation at market.  Not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any one 
company may be held by the portfolio. 
 
In order for an international security to be eligible for purchase by the Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA), the issuing company 
must  be  incorporated  in  a  country  whose  debt  securities  are  eligible  for  purchase  as  discussed  earlier,  and  the  fair  value  of  the 
aggregate outstanding equity of the issuing company must be at least $100 million.

4. Custodial Credit Risk 
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that an entity will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral 
securities that are in the possession of an outside party if the counterparty fails. 
 
State Treasurer – The State Treasurer’s policy with respect to repurchase agreements requires that the underlying securities be held in 
the counterparty’s safekeeping department, in the name of the State. 
 
Alabama Trust Fund (ATF) – The ATF’s custodian, Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM), administers a portion of the program for the 
ATF.  The ATF’s custodial credit risk policy authorizes BNYM to hold securities in registered form in the name of its nominee.  The 
policy requires BNYM to establish and maintain one or more securities accounts (book entry system) in which BNYM will hold the 
securities.  These accounts are in the name of the ATF. 
 
Retirement  Systems  of  Alabama  (RSA)  – The  RSA’s  custodial  credit  risk  policy  requires  the  custodial  agent  to  hold  or  direct  its 
agents or subcustodians to hold, for the account of the RSA all securities and other non-cash property other than securities in the 
Federal Reserve book-entry system, in a clearing agency which acts as a securities depository, or in another book-entry system.  The 
RSA’s  safekeeping  agent  holds  all  investments  of  the  RSA  in  the  RSA’s  name  with  the  exception  of  securities  purchased  with 
securities lending cash collateral.

5. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributable to the magnitude of a government’s investments with a single issuer.   The 
State of Alabama has large investments in U.S. Government obligations which are disclosed in the tables in this note.  Standard & 
Poor’s downgraded the rating of the U.S. Government to AA+, however the Moody’s rating is still Aaa.   
 
The  investment  policy  of  the  Alabama  Trust  Fund  states that  the  investment  portfolio  shall  be diversified  by both  asset  class  and 
within asset classes, by economic sector and industry.  For equity investments, the aggregate investment in equity securities of any one 
issuing corporation shall not exceed 1% of the outstanding capital of such corporation.  For fixed income investments, the portfolio is 
to be diversified so that no more than 15% is invested in one industry (does not apply to U.S. government and agency securities), and 
no more than 5% of the total fixed income portfolio may be invested in securities of any one corporation.  As of September 30, 2011, 
there were no investments that exceeded the 5% of the total fixed income portfolio limit in any one corporation. 
 
The  investment  policies  of  the  Retirement  Systems  of  Alabama  limit  the  aggregate  amount  that  can  be  invested  in  each  class  of 
investments.  Domestic fixed income, international fixed income, domestic equity, international equity,  and short-term investments 
are limited to 50%, 10%, 65%, 25%, and 20%, respectively, of the fair value of each System’s aggregate portfolio.  Also, each System 
may  not  purchase  or  hold  more  than 5% of  any  class of the  outstanding  stock of  a foreign  company.    Real  estate  and  alternative 
investments are limited to15% and 10%, respectively, of the book value of each System’s portfolio.  As of September 30, 2011, the 

 
82 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS) and Employees’ Retirement System (ERS) owned debt and equity securities of Raycom Media 
Corporation which represented approximately 8.22% and 9.03%, respectively, of the TRS and the ERS investments. 
 
The Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority has no stated policy for concentration of credit risk.  As of September 30, 2011, the 
Authority entered into Guaranteed Investment Contracts with AIG that comprise 12.45% of total holdings. 
 
The Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board owned securities in FMC Technologies, Inc., Liberty Mutual Group, Inc, 
Celgne  Corporation,  Nextera  Energy  Capital  Holdings,  South  Carolina  Fuel  Company,  Sempra  Energy  Global  Enterprise,  Nissan 
Motor Acceptance Corporation, Oneok, Inc., and Harris Corporation that constituted 14%, 13%, 12%, 10%, 10%, 8%, 8%, 7%, and 
5%,  respectively,  of  the  total  fair  value  of  investments.    The  State  Employees’  Insurance  Board  owned  debt  securities  in  Harris 
Corporation that comprised 11% of investment holdings. 

D. Securities Lending  
The  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (TRS),  the  Employees’  Retirement  System  (ERS),  and  the  Judicial  Retirement  Fund  (JRF)  are 
authorized  by  the  Boards  of  Control  to  participate  in  a  securities  lending  program.    The  Alabama  Trust  Fund  (ATF)  investment 
managers are authorized by the Board of Trustees to engage in securities lending under guidelines established by the ATF Investment 
Committee.  The Retirement Systems of Alabama’s (RSA) custodian, State Street Bank and Trust Company (State Street), administers 
the program for the TRS, ERS, JRF, a portion of the program for the ATF, and some other funds of the State.  Certain securities are 
loaned to borrowers approved by the RSA for collateral that will be returned for the same type of securities.  Approved borrowers of 
securities provide acceptable collateral in the form of cash (U.S. and foreign currency), any other assets permissible under Rule 15c3-3 
under the Exchange Act of 1934, U.S. and non U.S. equities and such other collateral as the parties may agree to in writing from time 
to time.  All security loans are open loans and can be terminated on demand by the lender or borrower.  The initial collateral received 
shall have (depending on the nature of the loaned securities and the collateral received), a value of 102% or 105% of the fair value of 
the loaned securities, or such other value, but not less than 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities, as may be applicable in the 
jurisdiction in which such loaned securities are customarily traded.  Pursuant to the terms of the applicable securities loan agreement, 
State Street shall, in accordance with State Street’s reasonable and customary practices, mark loaned securities and collateral to their 
fair value each business day based upon the fair value of the collateral and the loaned securities at the close of the business employing 
the most recently available pricing information and shall receive and deliver collateral in order to maintain the value of the collateral 
at no less than 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities.  The lender cannot pledge or sell collateral securities received unless the 
borrower defaults. 
 
Cash collateral for TRS, ERS, and JRF is invested in the State Street Quality D Short-term Investments Fund (QDF).  Cash collateral 
administered by State Street for ATF is invested in the State Street Global Securities Lending Trust (GSLT).   As of September 30, 
2011,  the  average  term  of  the  loans  secured  by  QDF  was  20,  29,  and  17  days,  respectively  for  the  TRS,  ERS,  and  JRF.    As  of 
September 30, 2011, the average term of the loans secured by GSLT was 48 days for the ATF.   Cash collateral investments are 
matured as needed to fulfill loan obligations.  There is no direct matching of the maturities of the loans with the investments made 
with cash collateral. The following describes the QDF’s and the GSLT’s guidelines.  The Investment Manager (State Street Bank) 
shall  maintain  the  dollar-weighted  average  maturity  of  QDF  and  GSLT  in  a  manner  that  the  Investment  Manager  believes  is 
appropriate to the objective of each; provided, that (i) in no event shall any eligible security be acquired with a remaining legal final 
maturity (i.e., the date on which principal must be repaid) of greater than 18 months, (ii) the Investment Manager shall endeavor to 
maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity of the QDF and GSLT not to exceed 75 calendar days and (iii) the Investment Manager 
shall endeavor to maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity to final of the QDF and GSLT not to exceed 180 calendar days.  At the 
time of purchase (i) all eligible securities with maturities of 13 months or less shall (a) be rated at least A1, P1 or F1 by at least any 
two  of  the  following  nationally  recognized  statistical  rating  organizations:    Standard  &  Poor’s  Corp.  (“S&P”),  Moody’s  Investor 
Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), or Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”), or (b) be determined by the Investment Manager to be of comparable quality and 
(ii) all eligible securities with maturities in excess of 13 months shall (a) be rated at least A-, A3 or A- by at least any two of S&P, 
Moody’s or Fitch, or (b) be determined by the Investment Manager to be of comparable quality.  The QDF and the GSLT may invest 
up to 10% of assets at time of purchase in commingled vehicles managed by the Trustee or its affiliates that conform to the Investment 
Policy  Guidelines.    The  QDF  and  the  GSLT  both  have  duration  pools.    The  duration  pools  include  all  asset  backed  securities 
(regardless of maturity) and securities of any type with a remaining maturity of 91 days or greater.  Each investor owns a specified 
percentage interest in the duration pool which is redeemable only in kind, not in cash.  The duration pools will not make additional 
investments. 
 
The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) administers a portion of the securities lending program for the ATF. Certain securities from 
ATF are loaned to borrowers approved by the ATF Board of Trustees.  Approved borrowers of securities provide acceptable cash 
collateral in the form of Federal funds or New York Clearing House funds as applicable for a particular loan.  All security loans are

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
open loans and can be terminated on demand by the ATF, BNYM, or the borrower.  The initial collateral received shall have (i) in the 
case of loaned securities denominated in United States Dollars, cash collateral in the amount of 102% of the fair value of the loaned 
securities or (ii) in the case of loaned securities which are not denominated in United States Dollars, cash collateral in the amount of 
105% of the fair value of the loaned securities.  Pursuant to the terms of the applicable securities loan agreement, BNYM shall, in 
accordance with BNYM’s reasonable and customary practices, mark loaned securities to their fair value each business day based upon 
the fair value of the loaned securities as of the close of the preceding business day, employing the most recently available pricing 
information,  and  receive  and  deliver  collateral  in  order  to  maintain  the  value  of  cash  collateral  at  no  less  than  the  collateral 
requirement.  The ATF cannot pledge or sell collateral securities received unless the borrower defaults.  As of September 30, 2011, the 
average term of the loans was 123 days.  Cash collateral investments are matured as needed to fulfill loan obligations.  All approved 
investments  shall  be  for  the  account  and  risk  of  ATF.    To  the  extent  any  loss  arising  out  of  approved  investments  results  in  a 
deficiency in the amount of collateral available for return to a borrower, ATF agrees to pay BNYM on demand cash in an amount 
equal to such deficiency. 
 
The following describes the manner in which BNYM is authorized to invest and reinvest cash collateral for the ATF. 

  Securities issued or fully guaranteed by the United States Government and any agency, instrumentality, or establishment of 

the United States Government (“Government Securities”). 

  High-grade commercial paper, notes, bonds, and other debt obligations including promissory notes, funding agreements, and 
guaranteed investment contracts whether or not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Such obligations 
may have fixed, floating, or variable rate interest payment provisions.  

  Asset-backed securities which carry the highest credit rating by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s. 
  Certificates of deposit, time deposits and other bank obligations of U.S. banks, their branches and subsidiaries.   
  Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by approved investments. 
  Securities, units, shares and other participations in money market funds, unregistered short-term investment funds, pools or 

trusts. 

 

  Government securities have no maturity limit.  Fixed rate instruments shall have a maturity of no greater than 13 months.  
Floating rate instruments rated “A” or “AA” shall have maturities no greater than three years with resets no less frequent than 
three months.  Floating rate instruments rated “AAA” shall have maturities no greater than five years with resets no less 
frequent than three months.

E. Mortgage-Backed Securities 
The  State  of  Alabama  invests  in  mortgage-backed  securities  to  improve  yield  and  adjust  the  duration  of  the  State’s  fixed  income 
portfolio.  Embedded prepayment options cause these investments to be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Prepayments of 
the underlying assets reduce the total interest payments to be received.  Generally, when interest rates fall, obligors tend to prepay the 
mortgages thus eliminating the stream of interest payments that would have been received under the original amortization schedule.  
The resulting reduction in cash flow diminishes the fair value of the mortgage-backed securities.  
 
The Alabama Trust Fund (ATF) invests in TBA (to be announced) purchase commitments, pursuant to which it agrees to purchase 
mortgage-backed  securities.    The  TBA  market  developed  in  response  to  the  demands  of  market  participants  for  more  liquidity  in 
trading mortgage-backed securities.  The TBA market is essentially a forward or delayed delivery market.  The lender, or other market

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
participant, will enter into a forward contract to sell mortgage-backed securities in the TBA market, promising to deliver mortgage-
backed securities on the settlement date sometime in the future.  At September 30, 2011, the ATF had investments in TBA mortgage-
backed  securities  in  the  amounts  of  $91,201,000.    Included  in  investment  purchases  payable  on  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  is  a 
liability related to the cost of acquiring these securities.  Generally, these securities are closed with a gain or loss prior to settlement.  
However, the ATF would be obligated for those amounts should the securities be delivered. 

F. Capital Assets 
Historical costs for infrastructure assets are included in this report.  The State elected to include the historical costs of all infrastructure 
assets, not just assets capitalized since 1980, as required by GASB Statement No. 34.  The State capitalizes infrastructure when all 
costs  for  a  project  are  incurred  and  all  project  documentation  is  completed  and  filed  with  the  appropriate  entities.    Due  to  the 
documentation requirements, there can be substantial time lags between the date a project is put into service and the date the project is 
capitalized.  A significant portion of Infrastructure Construction in Progress consists of projects that have been put into service and 
maintenance costs could have been incurred but the project documentation is not complete.  For Business-Type activities, decreases in 
construction in progress are large relative to increases in capital assets because Port Authority constructs some equipment assets.  As 
of September 30, 2011, the capital assets for the Primary Government and the Component Units are presented in the following tables:

G. Derivatives 
Alabama  State  Port  Authority  -  In  December  2002,  the  Alabama  State  Port  Authority  entered  into  a  swaption  contract  with  an 
investment company in order to monetize potential debt service savings on the Authority’s callable 1996 Series bond.  The swaption 
gave  the  counterparty  the  option  to  enter  into  a  variable-to-fixed  interest  rate  swap  at  a  specified  future  date.    The  counterparty 
exercised its option on July 18, 2006 and the interest rate swap commenced on October 1, 2006, with the Authority paying a fixed 
interest  rate  (5.38%)  and  the  Authority  receiving  a variable  interest  rate  (67% of  the  one-month  LIBOR).    The Authority  may  be 
exposed to various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk through the interest rate swap.  As the interest rate swap is a liability 
at September 30, 2011 and 2010, the impact of credit risk is minimized.  The swap agreement is based on an original notional amount 

 
88 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
of $60,455,000, valued at $59,760,000 at September 30, 2010, and expires on October 1, 2021.  Upon exercising of the option by the 
counterparty, the Authority issued variable-rate refunding bonds in an amount sufficient to refund the fixed rate Series 1996 revenue 
bonds.  As of September 30, 2011, the interest rate swap had a negative fair value of approximately $15,350,000 and is included in the 
Statement of Net Assets in Noncurrent Liabilities: Due in More Than One Year as Other Long-Term Liabilities. The $719,000 change 
in fair value is included in investment income in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets and is included in 
investment earnings in the Statement of Activities.  The interest rate swap value is calculated using an industry accepted option pricing 
model that uses market interest rates and volatility assumptions on the valuation date.  The interest rate and volatility data is used to 
calculate the present value of the potential future cash flows of the swap.   
 
University of South Alabama - In January 2008, the University of South Alabama entered into a synthetic advance refunding of the 
outstanding Series 2004 and 2006 bonds with a counterparty.  This transaction was effected through the sale of two swaptions by the 
University to the counterparty.  The transactions resulted in an up-front payment to the University totaling $9,328,000, which was 
recorded as a liability, in exchange for selling the counterparty the option to enter into an interest rate swap with respect to the Series 
2004 and 2006 bonds in 2014 and 2016, respectively.  The objective of this transaction is to realize debt service savings currently from 
future debt refunding and create an economic benefit to the University.  If the counterparty exercises its options in 2014 and 2016, the 
University would, at the counterparty’s option, be forced into an underlying swap.  If the option is exercised, the University would 
begin  to  make  payments  on  the  notional  amount,  currently  $41,125,000  and  $100,000,000  for  the  2004  bonds  and  2006  bonds, 
respectively, of the underlying swap contract.  Simultaneously, the University would call outstanding 2004 and 2006 bonds and issue 
variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) in their place.  Under the swap contract, the University would pay a fixed rate of 4.9753% on the 
2004 bonds and 5.0% on the 2006 bonds to the counterparty and would receive payments based on 68% of the one-month LIBOR 
index.  Alternatively, although it is not anticipated that this option would be to the University’s advantage, the University could, at its 
option, cash settle the swap and retain its right to refund the 2004 and 2006 bonds.  If the interest rate environment is such that the 
counterparty chooses to not exercise its option, the swaptions would be canceled and the University would have no further obligation 
under this agreement.  A swaption is considered a hybrid instrument and as such the payment by the counterparty to the University 
must  be  bifurcated  into  two  components,  a  borrowing  component  and  an  embedded  derivative  component,  and  each  component 
treated separately.  The embedded derivative value of the swaptions represents the fair value resulting from the fact that the fixed rate 
stated in the swaptions is greater that the at-the-market rate.  The initial value of the borrowing is the difference between the upfront 
payment and the fair value of the embedded derivative and represents the time value to the counterparty for holding the option, or the 
probability weighted, discounted values of a range of future possible outcomes.  The values of the derivative and borrowings at the 
date  of  execution  of  this  transaction  are  embedded  derivatives  $918,000  for  2004  bonds  and  $3,343,000  for  2006  bonds  and 
borrowings of $1,070,000 for 2004 bonds and $3,997,000 for 2006 bonds.  The September 30, 2011 values of the borrowings are 
included  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  in  Noncurrent  Liabilities  and  included  in  Capital  Leases/Notes/Mortgages  in  the  table  of 
Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities in Note 4.D.9.  Interest is being accreted on, and added to, the borrowing through the expiration 
date of the option.  At September 30, 2011, the fair values of the derivatives are approximately $(20,661,000), and are included on the 
Statement of Net Assets in Noncurrent Liabilities and in Other Long-term Liabilities in the table of Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities 
in Note 4.D.9.  For the year ended September 30, 2011, the $(7,334,000) change in the fair value of the derivatives is included in 
investment earnings in the Statement of Activities. 
 
Fair Value.  At September 30, 2011, the embedded derivatives had fair values of $(20,661,000).  The fair values of the embedded 
derivatives were estimated using the zero-coupon method.  This method calculates the future net settlement payments required by the 
instruments, assuming that the current forward rates implied by the yield curve correctly anticipate future spot interest rates.  These 
payments are then discounted using the spot rates implied by the current yield curve for hypothetical zero-coupon bonds due on the 
date of each future net settlement. 
   
Interest Rate Risk.  Interest rate risk, as a result of rising short-term interest rates causing higher interest rate payments, is effectively 
hedged by the University’s fixed rate bonds.  If the counterparty exercises its options, the underlying swaps are expected to effectively 
hedge the potentially higher payments on VRDNs as well.  The University is also subject to interest rate risk, as a result of changes in 
long term interest rates, which may cause the value of fixed rate bonds or interest rate derivatives to change.  If long term interest rates 
fall  subsequent  to  the  execution  of  this  transaction,  the  value  of  the  swaptions  will  change,  with  negative  consequences  for  the 
University.   
 
Market  Access  Risk.    This  transaction  assumes  that  VRDNs  will  be  issued  as  a  replacement  of  the  2004  and  2006  bonds.    If  the 
University is unable to issue variable rate bonds after the counterparty exercises its right under the swaptions, the University would 
still  be  required  to  begin  making  periodic  payments  on  the  swaps,  even  thought  there  are  no  related  bonds.    Alternatively,  the 
University could choose to liquidate the swaps, which may create a substantial cash outlay.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
Basis Risk.  If the counterparty exercises its option, there is a risk that the floating payments received under the swaps will not fully 
offset the variable rate payments due on the assumed VRDNs. 
 
Credit Risk.  Although the underlying swap exposes the University to credit risk should the swap be executed, the swaption itself does 
not expose the University to credit risk.  If the option is exercised on one or both issues, the University would begin to make payments 
on the appropriate notional amount of the underlying swap contract.  In that situation, if the fair value of the swap is positive, the 
University  would  be  exposed  to  credit  risk  on  the  swap  in  the  amount  of  its  fair  value.    As  of  September  30,  2011,  the  swap 
counterparty was rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Services and AA by Standard and Poors Rating Services. 
 
Termination Risk.  The University may be required to terminate the swaptions or swaps under certain circumstances, such as credit 
downgrades or other events specified in the contracts.  In the event that a position needs to be terminated, the University may owe a 
substantial amount of money to terminate the contracts.  At September 30, 2011, no events of termination have occurred.  
 
Alabama State University – During fiscal year 2005, the Board of Trustees of the University authorized the University to enter into a 
swaption agreement relating to a forward-starting interest rate swap in the notional amount of $6,775,000 relating to the University’s 
Series 2002B Bonds.  Under the agreement, the University received a cash payment in the amount of $550,000 from Bear Sterns 
Capital Markets, Inc. (BSCM).  BSCM transferred its interests in the swaption to J. P. Morgan Chase Bank (JPM) which may, at its 
option, execute the swap agreement within one year of January 1, 2012, which represents the exercise period.  In the event JPM elects 
to exercise its option to enter into the swap agreement during the exercise period, JPM would be required to pay the University an 
exercise payment in the amount of $138,400 or $70,650 on January 1, 2013.  If exercised, the swap agreement would require the 
University to pay a fixed rate to JPM, which in turn, would be obligated to pay the University a variable rate priced at the Bond 
Market  Association  Municipal  Swap  Index  plus  0.25%.    As  of  September  30,  2011,  the  swaption  had  a  negative  fair  value  of 
$3,581,290.  Fair values were provided by a third party utilizing proprietary models based upon well recognized financial principles 
and  reasonable  estimates  about  relevant  future  market  conditions.    The  fair  value  is  included  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Assets  in 
Noncurrent Liabilities:  Due Within One Year and included in the table of Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities as Other Long-term 
Liabilities: Due Within One Year in Note 4.D.9.  The change in fair market value (decrease in fair value of $517,320) is reported as a 
component of investment earnings in the Statement of Activities. 
 
Interest Rate Risk.  The University is subject to interest rate risk, as a result of changes in long-term interest rates, which cause the 
value of fixed rate bonds or interest rate derivatives to change.  If long-term interest rates fall subsequent to the execution of the 
transaction, the value of the swaption will change, with negative consequences for the University. 
 
Credit Risk.  Although the underlying swap exposes the University to credit risk should the swap be executed, the swaption itself does 
not  expose  the  University  to  credit  risk.    If  the  option  is  exercised  then  the  university  would  begin  to  make  payments  on  the 
appropriate notional amount of the underlying swap contract.  In that situation, if the fair value of the swap is positive, the University 
would be exposed to credit risk on the swap in the amount of its fair value. 
 
Basis Risk.  If JPM exercises its option, there is a risk that the floating payments received under the swap will not fully offset the 
interest payments due on potential refunded debt. 
 
Termination Risk.  The University may be required to terminate the swaption under certain circumstances.  In the event that a position 
needs to be terminated, the University must pay JPM the fair value of the swaption. 
 
Alabama Public School and College Authority (Authority) - The Authority and JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan) entered into a 
Master Agreement dated March 13, 2002 (the "Swap Option Agreement"), with respect to the Authority's Series 1998 Bonds, Series 
1999-A Bonds, Series 1999-C Bonds, and Series 1999-D Bonds (collectively, the "Swap Bonds"). The Swap Option Agreement was 
subsequently amended on January 16, 2003. Under the terms of the Swap Option Agreement, the Authority received certain lump sum 
payments  in  the  amount  of  $12,587,000  from  JPMorgan  in  return  for  an  option  to  enter  into  fixed  payer  interest  rate  swaps  with 
respect to each of the Swap Bonds in the notional amounts of $283,715,000 with respect to the Series 1998 Bonds, $18,675,000 with 
respect to the Series 1999-A Bonds, $254,125,000 with respect to the Series 1999-C Bonds and $153,700,000 with respect to the 
Series 1999-D Bonds. Such option is exercisable by JPMorgan upon 150 days prior written notice on November 1 in the years 2008 
through 2011 for the Series 1998 Bonds, September 1 in the years 2009 and 2010 for the Series 1999-A Bonds, July 1 in the years 
2009  through  2011  for  the  Series  1999-C Bonds,  and  on  August  1  in  the  years  2009  through  2011  for  the  Series  1999-D  Bonds. 
JPMorgan notified the Authority of its intention to exercise its option with respect to the Series 1998 Bonds, effective November 1, 
2008, the effect of which under the Swap Option Agreement would have been to require the Authority to issue variable rate bonds for 
the purpose of refunding the Series 1998 Bonds.  On December 20, 2010, the Declaratory Judgment Action from 2008 in regard to the 
March, 2002 interest swap agreement along with the 2003 amendments between Alabama Public School and College Authority and JP

Morgan Chase Bank N.A., was settled.  The Authority made a payment to JP Morgan of $19,000,000 in return for a full settlement of 
claims and mutual release from the swap agreement. 
 
The Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) - The RSA enters into call and put options.  The RSA uses these derivative instruments to 
make an investment, control risk with certain investment positions, or as a yield enhancement strategy.  During the fiscal year, these

Alabama Trust Fund (ATF)  - Derivatives can be used by the ATF’s investment managers to manage cash positions, gain broad stock 
or  bond  market  exposure  and  to  manage  risks  with  certain  investment  positions.    The  ATF  Investment  Policy  allows  derivative 
instruments to be used provided that the collateral is held in highly liquid securities and that they do not create the effect of leverage in 
the portfolio. 
 
GASB Statement No. 53 requires that the fair value of the financial arrangements called “derivatives” or “derivative instruments” be 
reported in the financial statements of state and local governments.  The statement further requires that derivatives be categorized as 
either an investment derivative or a hedge derivative.  All of the ATF’s derivative exposures as of September 30, 2011, are categorized 
as investment derivatives and therefore the hedge accounting provisions of GASB Statement No. 53 are not applicable. 
 
All derivative instruments are presented in the Statement of Net Assets as Investments and are reported at fair value.  ATF’s custodian 
Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) uses market prices when available.  BNYM used two vendors to value derivatives when market 
values are not available.  The two vendors used by BNYM are Markit, and SuperDerivatives.  Both vendors consider their valuation

4. Encumbrances 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts and purchase orders for goods and services.  Encumbrances 
are  reported  within  governmental  funds  as  restricted,  committed,  or  assigned  fund  balance.    At  September  30,  2011,  there  were 
encumbrances in the Public Road and Bridge Fund totaling $56,759,000, the Medicaid Fund $4,374,000, the Public Welfare Trust 
Fund $3,073,000, and nonmajor governmental funds $33,258,000.   

5. Other Commitments 
The Alabama Housing Finance Authority, a component unit, has designated $66,638,000 of its unrestricted net assets for fiscal year 
September 30, 2011 for funding of future single-family mortgage revenue bond programs, to support its single-family mortgage loan 
origination and warehousing operations, and to cover its operating expense budget for the following fiscal year. 

B. Claims and Judgments 
The Department of Transportation finances its own risk for state employee injury compensation.  The Department had $9,366,000 in 
claims liabilities at the end of the year. 

C. Conduit Debt  
Troy  University,  a  component  unit,  issued  Special  Limited  Obligation  Revenue  Bonds  Series  1997  to  provide  athletic  facility 
improvements for Sartain Hall and Memorial Stadium.  The total amount of outstanding conduit debt as of September 30, 2011 is 
$3,965,000.  The bonds are limited obligations of the City of Troy and are payable entirely from the amounts received under the 
indenture.  The bonds do not constitute a debt or pledge of faith and credit of the University or the State of Alabama, and it is not 
reflected  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements.    Troy  University  has  procured  a  policy  of  municipal  bond  insurance  securing 
payment  of  debt  service  on  the  $4,820,000  Troy  University  Special  Limited  Obligation  Revenue  Bond  Series  1997  from  MBIA 
Insurance Corporation.   
 
Revenue bonds were issued by Alabama Housing Financing Authority, a component unit, which constituted conduit debt outstanding 
at  year-end  totaling  $162,554,000  to  provide  multifamily  housing  for  the  citizens  of  Alabama.  The  Authority  does  not  actively 
monitor the operating performance or financial condition of the multifamily properties financed by the bonds. Multifamily mortgage 
loans are collateralized by varying methods, including first-liens on multifamily residential rental properties located within the State of 
Alabama, letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees provided by third parties. These bonds do not constitute a debt or pledge of the 
faith  and  credit  of  the  Authority  or  the State  of  Alabama,  and  accordingly,  have  not been  reported in  the  accompanying  financial 
statements. 

D. Long-term Debt 

1. Debt Limitations and Methods of Bond Issuance 
Under Section 213 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as modified by Amendment 26, the State is constitutionally prohibited 
from incurring debt except to repel invasion or suppress insurrection.  Therefore, the only method under which general obligation debt 
can  be  incurred  is  by  amendment  to  the  Constitution.    Although  conventions  proposed  by  the  legislature  and  approved  by  the 
electorate may be called for the purpose of amending the Constitution, historically all amendments have been adopted by a procedure 
which requires them to be proposed by a three-fifths majority of each house of the legislature and thereafter ratified by a majority of 
the electorate. 
 
The Supreme Court of Alabama has ruled that the debt prohibition does not apply to debts incurred by separate public corporations 
functioning as state instrumentalities.  The State has followed the practice of financing many capital improvements and developmental 
grant programs by issuing debt through such public corporations.  The legislature (through enabling legislation) and the Governor (by 
executive order) have created public corporations and authorities of the State for the purpose of financing projects and programs such 
as public highways, public educational facilities, judicial buildings, student loans, affordable housing, economic development grants, 
and other projects.  In most instances, state officials such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, State Treasurer, 
and the Director of Finance serve as board members of these corporations.  The revenue bonds issued by these corporations are limited 
obligations of the corporation, not general obligations of the State, and the full faith and credit of the State is not pledged for their 
repayment.  Certain revenues, usually earmarked taxes or revenues generated from the project financed, are pledged for the payment 
of the debt.  Depending on the GASB criteria discussed in Note 1, some of these corporations are reported by blending them with the 
primary government and some are reported discretely.  The State also enters into lease purchase agreements which are reported in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as capital lease debt or notes payable.   

 
94 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The State and its component units issue serial and term bonds and capital appreciation bonds.  Capital appreciation bonds are sold at a 
deep discount and do not pay any interest until the bonds mature.  Based on the original offering price, the bonds increase in value as 
semi-annual interest is earned and is compounded from the original issuance date to the date of maturity.  The issuance of this type 
bond postpones the cash flow until the bonds mature or are called.  The increase in the value of the bonds is referred to as accretion. 

2. General Obligation Bonds – Governmental Activities 
The State has general obligation bond issues outstanding for the purpose of financing major capital projects for:  state waterways, 
State Port Authority’s facilities, prisons, roads, bridges, mental hospitals, Mobile harbor, state parks, youth services facilities, state 
buildings,  the  State  Coliseum,  conservation  and  preservation  projects,  educational  television,  forensic  sciences  laboratories, 
agricultural development, diagnostic and research laboratories, and historical projects.  General obligation bonds also finance grant 
programs for public school and college buildings, as well as economic development grants to industry and local government.  The full 
faith and credit of the State is pledged for the payment of the bonds.  The following schedule shows the general obligation annual debt 
service requirements and is followed by a detailed table describing each individual general obligation bond issue outstanding:

State.  Each bond issue is secured, as described in the applicable trust indenture, by all revenues, monies, investments, mortgage loans,

bonds.

are used for payment of debt service related to the bonds.

housing facilities for the campers.  The bonds are secured by a lease of the facilities to the Space Science Exhibit Commission as well 
as a pledge of all revenues of the Commission.  At September 30, 2011, the outstanding principal balance of the 2009-A bonds was 
$4,255,000.  The interest rate is variable and equal to 70% of LIBOR plus 3%, but at no time less than 4.3%.  The interest rate was 
4.3% as of September 30, 2011.   

The boards of the various institutions of higher education have numerous bond issues outstanding for a variety of purposes.  Most

facilities, dormitories, student centers, dining facilities, hospitals, and athletic facilities.

4. Refunded Bonds  
Advance  refunding  bonds  are  issued  to  retire  existing  bonds.    A  portion  of  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  refunding  bonds  is 
deposited with an escrow agent according to an escrow trust agreement.  The proceeds are invested by the escrow agent in certain U.S. 
Treasury obligations in such amounts with certain maturities to provide sufficient funds to pay the remaining maturing principal and 
interest  on  the  refunded  bonds  as  they  become  due.    The  refunded  bond  debt  is  considered  to  be  retired  for  financial  reporting 
purposes even though the debt is still legally outstanding and the issuer of the bonds has not been released from the debt obligations.  
The U.S. Treasury obligations constitute a trust fund to be held by the escrow agent for the benefit of the holders of the refunded 
bonds.  Advance refundings and early redemptions are discussed in the remainder of this section. 
 
During  the  year  ended  September  30,  2011,  the  Alabama  Housing  Finance  Authority  called  approximately  $103,083,000  (net  of 
unamortized discounts) of bonds in advance of their scheduled maturities.  
 
On November 17, 2010, the Alabama Revolving Loan Fund Authority issued Special Obligation and Refunding Bonds Series 2010-A 
in the amount of $20,755,000 with interest rates from 2.5% to 6.125%.  An original issue premium of $51,435 was received on the 
sale of the bonds.  The bond proceeds were used to refund, on a current basis, the Series 2000 bonds with an aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of $8,330,000.  The refunding resulted in an accounting loss of $374,804.  The Authority recognized an economic 
gain of $1,360,871 and a reduction in the cash flows required to service the new debt compared to the cash flows to service the old 
debt of $734,804. 
 
In  December,  2010,  the  Alabama  State  Port  Authority  issued  Series  2010  Docks  Facilities  Revenue  Bonds  in  the  amount  of 
$106,045,000.  An original discount of $3,416,756 was discounted on the sale of the bonds.  The bond proceeds were used to refund 
the Series 2008B and 2009A bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $95,000,000.  As a result of the refunding the 
Port Authority recognized an economic gain of $1,526,114.

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
APSCA had an economic gain related to the refunding of $3,992,597 and a reduction in  the cash flows required to service the new 
debt versus the cash flows to service the old debt of $138,566. 
 
On December 1, 2010, Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority issued the 2010C Refunding Series revolving loan bonds in the 
amount of $36,850,000 for the purpose of refunding the Series 2000 Bonds that had an aggregate principal balance of $43,370,000. 
The refunding resulted in an accounting loss of approximately $608,991 that has been capitalized and is being amortized on a straight-
line basis, through 2023.  Although the refunding resulted in a loss, the Authority reduced its aggregate debt service by approximately 
$17,300,000 over the next 13 years and obtained an economic gain (the difference between the present value of old and new debt 
service  requirements)  of  approximately  $7,300,000.  As  of  September  30,  2011,  the  unamortized  deferred  refunding  costs  totaled 
$568,924 for the Series 2000 Bonds. 
 
On  August  23,  2011,  The  Alabama  Federal  Aid  Highway  Finance  Authority  issued  the  Series  2011  Federal  Highway  Grant 
Anticipation  Refunding  Bonds  in  the  amount  of  $91,195,000  with  interest  rates  from  1%  to  5%.    The  2011  bonds  were  used  to 
advance refund $96,755,000 of the Series 2002A bonds.  The refunding resulted in an accounting loss of $2,476,304.  The Authority 
had an economic gain related to the refunding of $8,544,198 and a reduction in the cash flows required to service the new debt versus 
the cash flows to service the old debt of $19,084.  
 
On  August  1,  2011,  Jacksonville  State  University  issued  revenue  bonds  with  an  interest  rate  of  2.94%  to  advance  the  refund 
$11,580,000 of the 2002 revenue bonds with an interest rate of 4.87%.  The advance refunding resulted in a difference between the 
reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of old debt of $7,384. As a result of the advance refunding, the University reduced its 
total debt service requirements by $564,197, which resulted in an economic gain (difference between the present value of the debt 
service payments on the old and new debt) of $546,140. 
 
On November 30, 2010, the University of North Alabama issued $9,850,000 in Series 2010A General Fee Revenue Bonds with an 
interest rate of 2.00% to 4.00%.  The Series 2010A refunded $10,600,000 Series 1999A General Fee Revenue Bonds.  The bonds will 
mature in 2024. 
 
On December 14, 2010, Troy University issued Series 2010A Revenue Bonds with an interest rate of 3.34% to advance refund the 
Series 1998, 2001, 2003, and 2004 revenue bonds with an average interest rate of 4.41%. On January 13, 2011, the Series 1998, 2001 
and 2004 Revenue Bonds were paid in full and retired with escrow proceeds. The Series 2003 revenue Bonds are considered defeased 
as of September 30, 2011.  As a result of the refunding, the University reduced its total debt service requirements by $662,537, which 
resulted in an economic gain of $568,181. 
 
In November, 2010, the University of Alabama - Birmingham issued $34,550,000 in Series 2010C General Revenue Bonds.  The 
bonds pay interest at varying rates 2% to 4% with principal due annually through October 1, 2027.  The proceeds of this offering are 
being used to advance refund $37,700,000 of the Series 2001 General Revenue Bonds. 
 
On October 29, 2010, the Alabama Higher Education Loan Corporation (AHELC), a nonmajor component unit, paid in full at par plus 
accumulated interest $75,100,000 Series 2006-A1 and Series 2006-A2 bonds.  The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
(HCERA) of 2010 was signed into law on March 30, 2010.  HCERA eliminates the origination and/or guarantee of FFELP loans, 
effective July 1, 2010.  HCERA does allow lenders to make subsequent disbursements on loans originated on or before June 30, 2010.  
Since the Corporation cannot fund any new FFELP loans after June 30, 2010, a strategic decision was made to sell the entire FFELP 
Loan Portfolio and utilize the proceeds of that sale and additional equity to redeem its outstanding bonds and eliminate all of the 
Corporation’s debt.  The loan portfolio was offered for sale through a competitively bid transaction.  On October 19, 2010, the loans 
were sold to a reputable lender and servicer of FFELP loans who also agreed as a part of the transaction to honor all of the AHELC 
borrower benefits that were attached to the loans.

5. Arbitrage 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that governmental entities issuing tax-exempt debt subsequent to August 1986, to calculate and 
rebate arbitrage earnings to the federal government.  The U.S. Treasury has issued regulations on calculating the rebate amount and 
complying with the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Governmental issuers must comply with the rebate regulation in order 
for their bonds to maintain tax-exempt status. 
 
The regulations require the excess of the aggregate amount earned on investments purchased with bond proceeds over the amount that 
would  have  been  earned  if  the  proceeds  were  invested  at  a  rate  equal  to  the  bond  yield  to  be  rebated  to  the  federal  government.  
Income earned on excess earnings is also subject to rebate.  Rebate payments, if required, are due at least once every five years over 
the life of the bonds.  Bond issues with arbitrage liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2011, were as follows:

These lists are based upon incomplete data since some bond issues have not yet been included in arbitrage calculations.  Any refunded 
bond issue is subject to the rebate requirement until the last bond is redeemed.  Bond issues that have already been redeemed may be 
subject to additional payments if an arbitrage rebate or spending payment is owed and has not been paid.

7. Derivative Transactions 
University  of  South  Alabama  -  On  February  27,  2007,  the  University  of  South  Alabama  Research  and  Technology  Corporation 
entered into a derivative transaction with Wachovia Bank, N.A.  The derivative is a “receive variable, pay fixed” interest rate swap 
entered into in connection with the promissory note that came into effect upon conversion of the construction loan into a permanent 
loan on May 1, 2008.  The Corporation utilizes the interest rate swap to convert its variable rate on the promissory note to a synthetic 
fixed rate.  The promissory note came into effect on May 1, 2008, upon conversion of the construction loan.  Also, on May 1, 2008, 
the interest rate swap associated with the loan became effective.  The swap will terminate on My 1, 2028, when the loan matures.  The 
notional amount of the swap will at all times match the outstanding principal amount of the loan.  Under the swap, the Corporation 
pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 6.10% and receives a variable payment of the one-month LIBOR rate plus 0.85%.  The 
Corporation paid $847,000 and $864,000 under the interest rate swap agreement for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, 
respectively, which is reflected as an increase in expenses in the Statement of Activities. 
 
Fair Value.  At September 30, 2011 the fair value of the interest rate swap is $(4,629,000), and is included on the Statement of Net 

 

106 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Assets in Noncurrent Liabilities and in Other Long-term Liabilities in the table of Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities in Note 4.D.9.  
The $(458,000) change in fair value is reported as a deferred outflow on the Statement of Net Assets since the interest rate swap is a 
hedging derivative instrument.  The fair value of the interest rate swap was estimated using the zero-coupon method.  This method 
calculates the future net settlement payments required by the swap, assuming that the current forward rates implied by the yield curve 
correctly anticipate future spot interest rates.  These payments are then discounted using the spot rates implied by the current yield 
curve for hypothetical zero-coupon bonds due on the date of each future net settlement. 
 
Interest Rate Risk.  On the Corporation’s “receive-variable, pay-fixed” interest rate swap, as LIBOR decreases, the net payment on the 
swap increases. 
 
Credit Risk.  As of September 30, 2011 the Corporation was not exposed to credit risk on the interest rate swap because it had a 
negative fair value.  However, if interest rates change and the fair value of the derivative becomes positive, the Corporation would 
have  a  gross  exposure  to  credit  risk  in  the  amount  of  the  derivatives’  fair  value.    The  counterparty  was  rated  Aa3  by  Moody’s 
Investors Services and AA by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services as of September 30, 2011. 
 
Termination Risk.  The interest rate swap contracts use the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement, 
which includes standard default and termination events, such as failure to make payments, breach of agreement, and bankruptcy.  At 
September  30,  2011,  no  events  of  default  or  termination  had  occurred.    If  the  interest  rate  swap  is  terminated,  interest  rate  risk 
associated with the variable rate debt would no longer be hedged.  Also, if at the time of termination the interest rate swap had a 
negative fair value, the Corporation would be liable to the counterparty for a payment equal to the interest rate swap’s fair value.  To 
allow  the  Corporation  the  maximum  flexibility  to  manage  the  utilization  of  Building  II  and  III  while  at  the  same  time  providing 
protection for the counterparty, the Corporation granted the counterparty a $2,000,000 mortgage secured by an interest in the ground 
lease with respect to the parcel of land on which Building II stands, an interest in Building II, a security interest in Building II tenant 
leases and a security interest in income received from rental of Building II. 
 
Alabama State University – Alabama State University has entered into a pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with J. P. Morgan 
Chase Bank with an objective of hedging cash flows on its Series 2004 Series General Revenue bonds with an effective date of August 
27, 2004 and a maturity date of March 1, 2033.  The terms of the agreement are for Alabama State University to pay 3.222% and 
receive 68% of the 30 day LIBOR rate.  The notional amount at September 30, 2011 was $22,900,000 and the hedging derivative 
liability was a negative $4,343,000.  The fair value is included in the Statement of Net Assets in Noncurrent Liabilities and included in 
Other Long-term Liabilities in the table of Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities in Note 4.D.9.  The $(1,206,300) change in fair value is 
reported in deferred outflows on the Statement of Net Assets. 
 
As of September 30, 2011, the synthetic interest rates on the swapped portion of the 2004 general revenue bonds were 3.06%.  The 
fair value of the pay-fixed rate swap was estimated through forecasting expected cash flows that are discounted.  The University’s 
interest rate swap hedging derivatives have been determined to be effective using the synthetic instrument method.   
 
Interest  Rate  Risk.    The  University  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  on  its  interest  rate  swap.    The  fair  value  of  this  instrument  is 
sensitive to interest rate changes.  Because rates have changed since the effective date of the swap, a negative fair value existed at 
September 30, 2011.  The negative fair value may be countered by a reduction in total interest payments required under the variable-
rate bonds, creating lower synthetic interest rates.  Because the coupons on the University’s variable-rate bonds adjust to changing 
interest rates, the bonds do not have corresponding fair value increases.  As the yield curve rises, the value of the swap will increase 
and as rates fall, the value of the swap will decrease. 
 
Credit  Risk.    As  of  September  30,  2011,  the  University  is  not  exposed  to  credit  risk  because  the  swap  has  a  negative  fair  value.  
However, should interest rates change and the fair value of the swap become positive, the University would be exposed to credit risk 
in the amount of the derivatives’ fair value. 
 
Basis Risk.  The University receives 68% of 1-month LIBOR Index from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (JPM) and pays a floating rate to its 
bondholders set by the Remarketing Agent.  The University incurs basis risk when its bonds trade at a yield above 68% of 1-month 
LIBOR Index.  If the relationship of the University’s bonds trade to a percentage of LIBOR greater than 68%, the University will 
experience an increase in debt service above the fixed rate on the swap. 
 
Termination Risk.  The interest rate swap agreement has a stated termination date of March 1, 2033; however, the University and 
counterparty, JPM have the right to terminate the agreement prior to such date upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events, 
and further, JPM ahs retained an option to terminate the agreement at any time on or after March 1, 2012 for any reason with no 
obligation to make any termination payment other than the amount of any regular periodic payment accruing to the termination date.

In addition, if the University terminates the agreement prior to March 1, 2033, the University would be liable to the counterparty for a 
payment equal to the swap’s negative fair value. 
 
Rollover  Risk.    The  University  is  not  exposed  to  rollover  risk,  because  the  maturity  dates  for  hedged  variable-rate  bonds  and  the 
interest rate swap agreement are the same, March 2033.

The State leases office buildings and equipment with varying terms and options.  Most buildings under capital lease have a term of 
twenty-five to thirty years, but can range from twenty to forty years.  Capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of 
the future minimum lease payments or fair market value.  Principal and interest capital lease payments are recorded as expenditures of 
the applicable governmental function in the governmental fund.  The largest capital leases in governmental activities are for buildings 
in county facilities used by the Department of Public Health and the Department of Human Resources.

Transfers are often made between funds as required by the legislature in the appropriation acts as well as by a variety of existing 
statutes.  Of the $249,245,000 transferred to other funds by the General Fund, $191,103,000 was transferred in compliance with the 
appropriation acts.  Of that amount, $84,124,000 was transferred to the Public Welfare Trust Fund, $40,080,000 was transferred to the 
Fair  Trial  Tax  Fund,  a  nonmajor  governmental  fund,    and  $34,545,000  was  transferred  to  the  Department  of  Public  Health.    The 
remaining General Fund transfers were made in small amounts to comply with a variety of statutes.   
 
Of the $382,187,000 transferred out of the Education Trust Fund, the appropriation acts as adjusted by proration required the transfer 
of  $345,628,000  to  other  funds.    Of  that  amount,  $337,687,000  was  transferred  to  supplement  the  operations  of  the  Alabama 
Community  College  System.    The  appropriation  acts  also  mandated  that  the  Internal  Service  Funds  receive  $1,109,000  to  fund 
telephone  and  computer  services  and  the  Public  Welfare  Trust  Fund  received  $12,565,000.    The  remaining  Education  Trust  Fund 
transfers were made in small amounts to comply with a variety of statutes.  
  
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board transferred $16,009,000 to the General Fund and $634,000 to the Public Welfare Trust Fund, 
which represents those funds’ statutorily mandated share of the Board’s profits.  
 
The Alabama Trust Fund, in compliance with amendments to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, is required to transfer to other 
funds  a  substantial  portion  of  its  investment  earnings  as  well  as  a  portion  of  new  income  from  offshore  oil  and  gas  rights.    In

compliance  with  these  amendments,  the  General  Fund  received  $120,163,000,  and  the  Nonmajor  Governmental  Funds  received 
$94,401,000.    Within  the  Nonmajor  Governmental  Funds,  the  Forever  Wild  Land  Trust  Fund  received  $15,000,000,  the  County 
Government  Capital  Improvement  Fund  received  $18,152,000,  the  Municipal  Government  Capital  Improvement  Fund  received 
$18,152,000, the Alabama Capital Improvement Trust Fund received $34,477,000, the County and Municipal Capital Improvement 
Trust Fund received $8,620,000. 
 
Medicaid transferred out $77,622,000 to the Public Welfare Trust Fund, and $233,521,000 to Nonmajor Governmental Funds to fund 
services provided to Medicaid recipients.  The Departments of Public Health, Youth Services, Senior Services, and Rehabilitation 
Services were the Nonmajor Governmental Fund recipients. The financial statements show $14,000 more transfers in and $20,000 
more transfers out for Internal Service Funds because transfers of capital assets were made between general government and Internal 
Service Funds. 
  

NOTE 6 - RISK MANAGEMENT 

 
The  State  manages  risk  through  risk  control  and  risk  financing  to  minimize  the  adverse  effects  of  certain  types  of  losses.    Risk 
financing includes self-insurance through several different funds.  The State Insurance Fund provides coverage for state buildings and 
contents  against  fire  and  casualty  losses.    The  General  Liability  Trust  Fund  insures  state  employees  against  the  risk  of  loss  from 
employment-related liability claims.  The State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund was created by the 1994 legislature to 
provide benefits to eligible state employees for job-incurred injury.  The State Insurance Fund, the General Liability Trust Fund, and 
the State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund are administered by the Division of Risk Management of the Department of 
Finance. 
 
There was no significant reduction in insurance coverage by the three Division of Risk Management funds from the prior year.  These 
funds do not have acquisition costs; therefore, no cost is amortized for the period.  The funds use the accrual basis of accounting for 
reporting  purposes.    As  required  by  GASB  Statement  No.  31,  “Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  for  Certain  Investments  and 
External Investment Pools,” most investments are recorded at fair value.  Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has 
occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated.  Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but 
not reported (IBNR).  Because actual claims liabilities depend on such complex factors as inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and 
damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in an exact amount.  Claims liabilities are 
reevaluated periodically to take into consideration recently settled claims, the frequency of claims, and other economic and social 
factors.    Estimated  claims  liabilities  are  calculated  by  a  professional  actuary  based  on  prior  claims  data.    Non-incremental  claims 
adjustment expenses have not been included as part of the liability for any of the funds. 
 
The separately issued financial report of the Division of Risk Management contains additional note disclosures and supplementary 
information regarding claims development and liabilities.

A. The State Insurance Fund 
The State Insurance Fund (SIF) was established in 1923 and is under the Code of Alabama 1975, Section 41-15-1 for the purpose of 
insuring direct physical loss on buildings and contents in which title in whole or in part is vested in the State of Alabama or any of its 
agencies or institutions or in which funds provided by the State have been used for the purchases of land, construction of buildings, 
purchase or maintenance of any equipment, machinery, furniture, fixtures or supplies in such buildings and public school buildings 
together with the contents of all such buildings. All covered property shall be insured for no more than its replacement cost and shall 
be insured for no less than 80 percent of its actual cash value.  Ten percent of actual cash value, salvage value, is used for property that 
is normally uninsurable.  City boards of education may insure school buildings and property either in the State Insurance Fund or with 
an insurance company, whichever in the opinion of such board provides the best coverage for such school buildings and property.  The 
principles of private industry insurance companies are utilized to establish rates, premium discounts, and experience credits to result in 
equitable premiums charged to policyholders.  Excess insurance and reinsurance is acquired to assure the solvency of the fund. 
 
Losses are recorded as current liabilities and expenses in the year reported.  IBNR recognizes losses that have occurred but have not 
yet been reported.  This liability and expense is determined by a professional actuary.  The SIF has a $10,000,000 cumulative loss 
annual deductible and a $3,500,000 specific loss deductible for all perils except named wind storms, and a $10,000,000 specific loss 
deductible for named wind storms.  Excess insurance covers claims exceeding the deductible with a $2 billion limit for named wind 
storms and a $1 billion limit for all other perils.  Payments received in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 for settlements in excess of 
deductibles totaled $50,917,000, $2,274,000, and $14,166,000 respectively.

B. General Liability Trust Fund 
The General Liability Trust Fund (GLTF) was established in 1984 to protect state employees from personal financial liability resulting 
from  lawsuits  that  are  based  on  alleged  negligence  while  acting  within  the  line  and  scope  of  state  employment.    Claims  are 
investigated and defended through the Office of the Attorney General.  Auto liability is fully reinsured and the re-insurer, American 
Southern Insurance Company, handles all claims.  The GLTF is managed much like a commercial insurance company, with exposure 
evaluated and commensurate premiums assigned to state agencies.  Investment activities are an essential part of the General Liability 
Trust Fund’s ability to maintain lower-cost employee liability coverage.  Funds in excess of those needed for immediate operations are 
invested to maximize return and keep premiums down. 
 
Losses are recorded as current liabilities and expenses in the year reported.  IBNR recognizes losses that have occurred but have not 
yet  been  reported.    This  liability  and  expense  is  determined  by  a  professional  actuary.    Excess  insurance  was  procured  effective 
January 15, 2011.  The coverage will aggregate paid losses in excess of $500,000 per claim.  When these losses exceed $3,000,000 in 
a policy year, claims in excess of the $500,000 deductible will be reimbursed up to a maximum recovery of $10,000,000 in any policy 
year.  Payments received in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 for settlements in excess of deductibles for old claims (prior to April 
2002) totaled $199,000, $0 and $2,834,000, respectively.

C. State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund 
The State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund (SEICTF) was created by the legislature on October 1, 1994.  Its purpose is to 
provide benefits to eligible state employees for job-incurred injury.  Benefits under SEICTF are administered by the Department of 
Finance,  Division  of  Risk  Management  in  accordance  with  the  Alabama  Administrative  Code  and  include  all  reasonable  medical 
expenses arising from a job-incurred injury, lost wages (including benefits for time lost from the job), and benefits to dependents of 
employees  who  are  fatally  injured  on  the  job.    Specifically  excluded  from  coverage  are  employees  of  the  State  Port  Authority, 
educational institutions, and local boards of education.  A key element in assuring effective and efficient operation of SEICTF was the

D. State Employees' Insurance Plan 
The State Employees' Insurance Plan (SEIP) was established in 1965 by Alabama Act No. 833 to provide health insurance benefits for 
state employees.  The SEIP is administered by the State Employees' Insurance Board (SEIB).  The monthly premiums for employee 
and  dependent  coverage  are  determined  annually  and  are  set  at  a  rate  necessary  to  provide  sufficient  funds  to  pay  all  claims  and 
reasonable expenses of administering the plans.  The State pays a monthly premium for each employee and the employee pays the 
established dependent premium.  The SEIB establishes claims liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims (including 
estimated  future  retroactive  claims  adjustments)  that  have  been  reported  but  not  settled,  and  of  estimated  claims  that  have  been 
incurred  but  not  reported.    Because  actual  claims  liabilities  are  affected  by  complex  changing  factors  such  as  inflation,  medical 
technology, and changes in legal doctrines, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not result in an exact amount.  Actual 
claims costs incurred may vary from estimated claims liabilities depending on the similarities in the nature and frequency of the claims 
between current and prior years.  Adjustments of the estimated claims liabilities based on actual results are charged or credited to 
expense in the periods in which such adjustments are determined. 
 
The SEIB also administers a local government health insurance plan (LGHIP) in the same manner as the SEIP.  The following table 
represents changes in those aggregate liabilities for SEIB during the past two years (approximately 60% of claim liabilities are related 
to the SEIP and the remainder to the LGHIP):

E. Public Education Employees' Health Insurance 
The  Public  Education  Employees'  Health  Insurance  Fund  (PEEHIF)  was  established  in  1983  by  the  provisions  of  Act  83-455  to 
provide a uniform plan of health insurance for current and retired employees of public educational institutions and to provide a method 
of funding the benefits related to the plan.  The plan is administered by the Public Education Employees' Health Insurance Board 
(PEEHIB). 
 
The State contributes a specified amount monthly to each respective participating school system.  Each participating school system 
must then pay the employer rate to the PEEHIF each month.  That rate was $752 per participant for 2011 and 2010.  In addition to the 
employer payments each month, the employee pays certain premium amounts.  PEEHIB established claims liabilities based on the 
actual cost of claims reported but not settled, and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported.  Actual claims costs 
ultimately incurred may vary from estimated claims liabilities should the nature and frequency of actual claims vary from historical 
claims experience on which the estimates are based.  Adjustments to claims liabilities are charged or credited to expense in the periods 
in which they are made. Note that $871,000 of unpaid claims at year-end is classified as due to the primary government.

F. Alabama Health Insurance Plan 
The  Alabama  Health  Insurance  Plan  (AHIP)  was  established  to  provide  health  insurance  coverage  to  eligible  individuals  as  an 
alternative to federal oversight required in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  AHIP was established in 
1997 under Regulation 115 pursuant to Act 97-713, codified as Section 27-52-1 in the Code of Alabama 1975, and is governed by an 
eight member Board of Directors.  The plan provides major medical benefits limited to $1,000,000 for the lifetime of a participant.  
The  plan  provides  that  participants  pay  monthly  premiums  for  health  insurance  coverage.    Coverage  is  also  available  for  eligible 
dependents of participants.  Premiums are determined annually and are set at a rate necessary to provide sufficient funds to pay all 
claims and reasonable expenses of administering the plan. 
 
Regulation No. 115 authorizes the Plan to recoup losses by assessing participating insurers based on their health insurance premiums 
written in the state for any year in which the Plan incurs a deficit.  Assessments in excess of actual losses are to be held in interest 
bearing accounts and used by AHIP to offset future losses or to reduce future assessments.  AHIP obtained funding from assessments 
totaling $5,510,000 and $3,901,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 
AHIP established claims liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims (including future retroactive claims adjustments) 
that have been reported but not settled and of estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported.  The estimation of claims 
costs depends on many factors including historical loss experience.  Adjustments of the estimated claims liabilities based on actual 
results are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which such adjustments are determined.

NOTE 7 - RETIREMENT PLANS 

A. Retirement Systems of Alabama 
The Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) administers the following three retirement programs for the benefit of state employees 
and public education employees: Teachers’ Retirement System, Employees’ Retirement System, and Judicial Retirement Fund.   

1. Plan Descriptions 
The Teachers' Retirement System of Alabama (TRS) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan, established as 
of  September  15,  1939, under  the  provisions  of  the  1939 Alabama  Acts  419.    The  TRS  provides  retirement  allowances  and  other 
specified benefits for qualified persons employed by State-supported educational institutions.  The Board of Control has responsibility 
for the general administration and operation of the TRS. 
 
The Employees' Retirement System of Alabama (ERS) is an agent multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan established as of 
October 1, 1945, under the provisions of the 1945 Alabama Acts 515.  The ERS provides retirement allowances and other specified 
benefits for state employees, state police, and on an elective basis, to all cities, counties, towns, and quasi-public organizations.  The 
Board of Control is responsible for the general administration and operation of the ERS.   
 
The  Judicial  Retirement  Fund  (JRF)  is  a  cost-sharing  multiple-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  established  under  the  1973 
Alabama Acts 1163.  The JRF provides retirement allowances and other specified benefits for any Justice of the Supreme Court of 
Alabama, Judge of the Court of Civil Appeals, Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, Judge of the Circuit Court, or office holder of 
any  newly  created  judicial  office  receiving  compensation  from  the  State  Treasury.    Act  Number  1205  of  the  legislature  of  1975 
supplemented the provisions of Act Number 1163 and enlarged the scope and coverage of the JRF to include District and Probate 
Judges.  The Board of Control of the ERS administers and operates the JRF.   
 
The TRS, ERS, and JRF provide retirement benefits as well as death and disability benefits as established by State law.  Changes to 
benefits, including ad hoc cost of living adjustments, must be established by statute.  Benefits for TRS and ERS members vest after 10 
years of credited service.  Teachers and state employees who retire after age 60 (52 for state police) with 10 years of credited service 
or with 25 years of service (regardless of age) are entitled to an annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life.  Service retirement 
benefits  are  calculated  by  two  methods  with  the  member  receiving  payment  under  the  method  which  yields  the  highest  monthly 
benefit:  (1) minimum guaranteed, or (2) formula.  Under the formula method, members of TRS and ERS (except state police) are 
allowed 2.0125 percent of their final average salary (highest 3 of the last 10 years) for each year of service.  State police are allowed 
2.875 percent for each year of state police service in computing the formula method.  Disability retirement benefits are calculated in

the same manner. JRF benefits vest from five to eighteen years.  Except for justices or judges who were either disabled, elected prior 
to July 30, 1979, or have at least 25 years of credited service, no justice or judge shall be eligible to receive judicial service retirement 
pay prior to attaining sixty years of age.  Service retirement benefits for justices and judges are dependent upon the particular office 
held in the judicial branch of government.  A retirement benefit is payable upon the request of any member who has:  (1) 25 years of 
credited service (regardless of age), (2) completed 12 years of credited service and has attained age 65, (3) completed 15 years of 
credited service and whose age plus service equals or exceeds 77,  (4) completed 10 years of credited service and has attained age 70, 
or (5) been elected prior to July 30, 1979 and has 18 years of service (regardless of age).  A member eligible to retire who has not 
requested his retirement benefit to commence at the end of the term in which his seventieth birthday occurs is entitled only to the 
refund of his contributions (except for members with at least 25 years of credited service).  The service retirement benefit for circuit, 
appellate, and probate judges is 75% of the member’s salary at the time of separation from service.  The service retirement benefit for 
a district judge is 75% of the position’s salary immediately prior to retirement. 
 
A pre-retirement death benefit is offered in which the account is credited with TRS and ERS employer contributions and investment 
income  on  such  funds.    The  pre-retirement  death  benefit  (group  term  life  insurance)  is  paid  in  addition  to  the  return  of  member 
contributions upon the death of an active TRS or ERS member who has completed at least one year of active membership in the 
system  and whose date of death was within 180  days  of  such  member's  last  date of actual  service.   However,  a surviving  spouse 
beneficiary of a deceased member who was eligible for service retirement may elect a survivor allowance in lieu of this benefit.  The 
pre-retirement death benefit is equal to the annual earnable compensation of the member as reported to the system for the preceding 
year ending June 30, for TRS and September 30, for ERS.  There is no pre-retirement death benefit available for JRF members. 
 
When  a  member  withdraws  from  service  prior  to  becoming  vested,  the  member's  accumulated  contributions  and  a  portion  of 
accumulated interest credited to the Annuity Savings account are returned to the member.  The portion of accumulated interest, which 
by law is not payable to the member, is transferred to the Expense Fund. 
 
RSA issued a stand-alone financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information (including the 
six-year trend) for the year ended September 30, 2011.  Copies may be obtained by writing to:

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a. Basis of Accounting 
The TRS, ERS, and JRF financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.  Contributions are recognized as 
revenues when earned, pursuant to plan requirements. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with requirements of the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  Under these requirements, the TRS, ERS, and JRF are considered component units of the 
State of Alabama. 

b. Investments 
The  Boards  of  Control  of  the  Systems  have  the  responsibility  and  authority  to  invest  and  reinvest  available  funds,  through  the 
Secretary-Treasurer  and  Investment  Committee,  in  bonds,  mortgage-backed  securities,  common  and  preferred  stock,  or  other 
investment vehicles with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in 
a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.  All plan assets are carried at fair value.  Securities traded on national or 
international exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates.  Short-term investments are reported at 
cost,  which  approximates  fair  value.    Mortgage-backed  securities  are  reported  based  on  future  principal  and  interest  payments 
discounted at the prevailing interest rate for similar instruments.  The fair value of real estate investments is based on independent 
appraisals. 
 
As of September 30, 2011, the TRS and ERS owned debt and equity securities of Raycom Media Corporation which represented 
approximately 8.22 percent and 9.03 percent, respectively, of the TRS and ERS investments. 

3. Contributions Required and Contributions Made 
The actuary has computed, as of the date of the latest available actuarial valuations (September 30, 2010 for TRS, ERS and JRF), the 
estimated present value of benefits payable to retired members, beneficiaries and active members.  The actuarial valuations for the 
TRS and ERS are prepared using the entry age method, while the JRF valuation utilizes the projected unit credit method. The present 
value of all expected benefits payable from each system to the present group of members and beneficiaries is calculated by adding the 
present value of the expected benefits payable to the active members to the present value of the expected future payments to retired 
members and beneficiaries. 
 
As  required  by  statute,  the  TRS,  ERS,  and  JRF  provide  for  employer  contributions  at  actuarially  determined  rates  (expressed  as 
percentages  of  annual  covered  payroll)  that  accumulate  sufficient  assets  to  pay  benefits  when  due.    The  employer  contributions 
required  to  support  the  benefits  of  each  system  are  determined  following  a  level  funding  approach  and  consist  of  a  normal 
contribution, an accrued liability contribution, and a portion to finance administrative costs. 
 
For the TRS and ERS, the normal contribution is determined using the “entry age normal” method.  Under this method, a calculation 
is made to determine the uniform and constant percentage rate of the employer contributions which, if applied to the compensation of 
the average new member during the entire period of the member's anticipated covered service, would be required in addition to the 
contributions of the member to meet the cost of all benefits payable on the member's behalf. The amortization method is level percent 
open for the September 30, 2010 actuarial valuations for the TRS and the ERS. The remaining amortization period is 30 years for the 
TRS, ERS-state employees, and ERS-state policemen. 
 
For the JRF, the normal contribution is determined using the “projected accrued benefit” (unit-credit) method.  Under this method, the 
benefits of each individual included in an actuarial valuation are allocated by a consistent formula to valuation years.  The actuarial 
gains (losses), as they occur, generally reduce (increase) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. The amortization method is level 
percent open for the September 30, 2010 actuarial valuation.  The remaining amortization period is 30 years.  
 
The required contribution rate of active plan members for TRS and ERS (excluding state policemen, and certified firefighters, police 
officers  and  correctional  officers)  was  5  percent  of  earnable  compensation  for  fiscal  year  2011.  State  policemen  were  required  to 
contribute  10  percent  of  earnable  compensation.    JRF  members  and  certified  firefighter,  police  officer,  and  correctional  officer 
members of the TRS and ERS were required to contribute 6 percent of earnable compensation.   
 
For fiscal year 2011, the required contribution rate of the employer for ERS (state employees) was 11.94 percent and the rate for TRS 
was  12.51  percent.    The  employer  contribution  rate  for  ERS  state  policemen  and  JRF  was  30.57  percent  and  24.20  percent, 
respectively.

B. Other Pension Plans 
The State Port Authority administers two single-employer pension plans, the Hourly Plan and the Terminal Railway Plan, for a small 
number of hourly workers and railway employees.  The Peace Officers Annuity and Benefit Fund is a cost-sharing multiple-employer 
defined benefit pension plan that provides a small additional pension benefit to state and local peace officers beyond that which is paid 
by the Employees’ Retirement System.  The Clerks and Registers Supernumerary Fund is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined 
benefit pension plan that provides pension benefits to circuit clerks and registrars of courts. These pension plans are not material to the 
State. 

NOTE 8 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
The  State  offers  employees  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  an  optional  deferred  compensation  plan  created  in  accordance  with 
Internal Revenue Service Code Section 457.  The plan is available to all state employees and permits them to defer a portion of their 
salary until future years.  The current value of the employee contributions may be withdrawn upon termination, retirement, death, or 
an unforeseeable emergency.  
 
It is the opinion of the State's legal counsel that the State has no liability for losses under this plan but does have the duty of due care 
that would be required of an ordinary prudent investor.  
 
The Public Employees' Individual Retirement Account Fund/Deferred Compensation Plan (RSA-1) is administered and operated by its 
Board of Control.  All members of the Teachers' Retirement System of Alabama, Employees' Retirement System of Alabama, Judicial 
Retirement Fund, and employees of employers eligible to participate in the Employees' Retirement System, are eligible to participate 
in this plan.  At September 30, 2011, net assets of the plan totaled $1,419,503,000.

State  employees  may  also  participate  in  a  plan  administered  by  Great-West  Retirement  Services.  This  plan  is  also  a  deferred 
compensation plan organized under IRC Section 457.  The plan contract requires the assets to be held in trust for the benefit of plan 
participants.  The State has no fiduciary responsibility for the assets and therefore does not include the plan in its reporting entity.  

NOTE 9 - POSTEMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFITS 
In addition to the pension benefits described in the Retirement Plans note, the State provides postretirement health care benefits, in 
accordance  with  Code  of  Alabama  1975,  Section  36-29-10,  to  all  retired  state  employees  through  the  State  Employees'  Health 
Insurance  Plan  (SEHIP)  and,  in  accordance  with  Code  of  Alabama  1975,  Section  16-25A-17,  to  all  retired  employees  of  state 
educational institutions through the Public Education Employees' Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP). The retiree portion of the SEHIP 
is accounted for through the Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust and the retiree portion of the PEEHIP is accounted 
for through the Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust (see plan description).  Employees covered under these two 
plans who retire from active service and begin receiving monthly benefits from the Employees' Retirement System of Alabama or 
from the Teachers' Retirement System of Alabama may elect to continue coverage under the group insurance plan by consenting to 
have  deducted  from  their  monthly  benefit  payment  the  difference  in  the  total  cost  of  their  insurance  coverage  and  the  portion 
authorized to be expended by the SEHIP or PEEHIP for coverage of such retired employees.  The State Employees’ Insurance Board 
administers SEHIP, and the Public Education Employees’ Insurance Board administers PEEHIP. 
  
In  order  to  fund  the  ongoing  costs  of  these  other  postemployment  benefits  (OPEB),  the  State  has  established  two  trust  funds  as 
described below to comply with GASB Statements 43 and 45.  

A. Plan Descriptions 
The Alabama Retired Education Employees’ Health Care Trust is a multiple employer cost-sharing defined benefit health care plan 
established as an irrevocable trust in 2007 by Constitutional Amendment 798.  As of the latest actuarial evaluation, there were 197 
participating employers. 
 
The  Alabama  Retired  State  Employees’  Health Care  Trust  is  a  single  employer  defined benefit  health  care  plan  established  as an 
irrevocable trust in 2007 by Constitutional Amendment 798.   
 
The  Public  Education  Employees’  Health  Insurance  Board  issued  a  stand-alone  plan  financial  report  for  the  Alabama  Retired 
Education Employees’ Health Care Trust that includes financial statements and detailed disclosures for the year ended September 30, 
2011.  A copy may be obtained by writing to:

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

1. Basis of Accounting 
Both Trusts are “other employee benefits trust funds” that operate under the accrual basis of accounting.  Plan member contributions 
are recognized in the period in which contributions are due.  Employer contributions are recognized when earned, pursuant to plan 
requirements.  Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan.   

 

126 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Investments 
All  plan  assets  are  carried  at  fair  value  except  short-term  investments  which  are  reported  at  cost,  which  approximates  fair  value.  
Securities traded on national or international exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates.  Mortgage-
backed securities are reported based on estimated future principal and interest payments discounted at the prevailing interest rate for 
similar instruments.  Investments not traded on exchanges are valued based on the selling price of similar investments sold in the open 
market.  In those instances where there are no similar investments sold in the open market, an appraisal is performed to determine the 
fair value of the investments. 

C.  Funding Policy 
The cost of the teachers’ health care benefits is paid from the regular appropriations made to individual education entities. The retired 
employee allocation is funded through the active employee premium. Retirees who are eligible for Medicare benefits must pay $10 per 
month for the Hospital/Medical coverage while those who are not eligible for Medicare must pay $146 per month for the coverage.  
Additional premiums are paid for dependents.  Optionally, the retirees may use this insurance allocation to purchase two plans of 
optional insurance offered by PEEHIP with no out-of-pocket cost.  The Early Retiree Reinsurance and Medicare Part D subsidy for 
fiscal year 2011 totaled $35,919,000.  Of this amount, $1,652,000 was an on-behalf payment for the primary government of the State 
of Alabama and $1,460,000 on-behalf payments of the major discretely presented component units of the State of Alabama.  Most of 
the remaining amount was on-behalf payments for local school boards that are not part of the State’s reporting entity. 
 
The State provides health care benefits for retired state employees through SEHIP.  For retirees who retired prior to October 1, 2005, 
the State pays 100 percent of the premium for a retiree who is over 65 and eligible for Medicare.  The State pays a portion of the 
premium for a retiree who is under 65.  Under the SEHIP statute, the State contribution per month per retiree is funded on a pay-as-
you-go basis through the active employee premiums each agency pays for its active employees.  COBRA insurance is also available to 
state employees who terminate state service, but the employee is liable for the premiums.  For retirees, who retire on or after October 
1, 2005 except for disability, Act 2004-648 provides that the State contribution for retiree health insurance premiums shall be based on 
years of service.  The State contribution to the health insurance premium shall be reduced by two percent for each year of service less 
than twenty-five and increased by two percent for each year of service over twenty-five.  The retiree is responsible for the amount of 
contribution not covered by the State. Also, the State may make additional contributions.  Additional funds were contributed during 
fiscal year 2011 in the amount of $9,950,000 as authorized by the SEHIP Board.   The Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy for the 
primary government, the component units, and the fiduciary funds was $9,883,000, $813,000, and $85,000, respectively, for fiscal 
year 2011. 

1. Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation 
Government Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment 
Benefits Other than Pensions, requires additional reporting and disclosures for OPEB plans. 
 
 The PEEHIP is a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan.  Contribution requirements are determined by statute.  In all instances, the 
state and its discretely presented component units paid 100% of the statutorily determined contribution requirements.  Therefore, the 
State has no net OPEB obligation related to the PEEHIP.   
 
The SEHIP is a single employer plan.  The following OPEB amounts are for the SEHIP:

to continual revision as actual results are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future.  The schedule of 
funding progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear 
trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued 
liabilities for benefits.

3. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions 
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer and 
the plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of 
benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point.  The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques 
that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent 
with the long-term perspective of the calculations.   The actuarial value of assets was determined using techniques that spread the 
effects of short-term volatility in the market value of investments over a five year period.

The assumed investment rate of return reflects the fact that as of September 30, 2008 the Plan had assets in a trust solely to provide 
benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries.  A policy has been established to make regular contributions representing a partial payment 
toward the ARC each year.  If the Plan starts fully pre-funding benefits, the discount rate may be increased to reflect equity investment 
the fund may have after full pre-funding begins.  This investment rate of return assumption is independent of the inflation assumption.

NOTE 12 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Montgomery Downtown Redevelopment Authority, a public corporation, issued $65,200,000 of bonds in 1988 to construct the 
Gordon Persons office building.  These bonds were partially refunded in 1992 with a new bond issue of $66,150,000.  The Series 1992 
bonds were refunded in 2002 with a new bond issue of $43,265,000.  The bonds' final maturity is on October 1, 2013.  Members of the 
board of directors of the Authority are appointed by officials of the City of Montgomery, but the Authority is not a part of the City's 
reporting entity and is therefore considered a separate "stand-alone government."  The bonds issued constitute conduit debt obligations 
of the Authority, and are therefore reported as revenue bond debt of the State.  The Authority has also issued conduit debt on behalf of 
other governments and third parties, none of which is reported in these financial statements.  The State operates and maintains the 
building  and  has  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Authority  whereby  the  rental  payments  from  state  agencies  occupying  the 
building are paid to the Authority, which then uses the money to pay the bond principal and interest.  The payments to the Authority 
are reported by the State as debt principal and interest expenditures. 
 
These financial statements exclude certain foundations and other organizations affiliated with state colleges and universities.  While 
the  purpose  of  these  foundations  and  associations  is  to  operate  exclusively  for  the  benefit  of  the  colleges  and  universities,  such 
organizations  do  not  constitute  component  units  under  the  provisions  of  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (GASB) 
Statement No. 14, "The Reporting Entity" and GASB Statement No. 39, an amendment to GASB 14.  These are:  the University of 
Alabama at Huntsville Eminent Scholar Foundation, the Alabama Engineering Foundation, the UAH Alumni Association, the UAH 
Athletic  Association,  the  UAH  Foundation  for  Excellence,  the  University  of  South  Alabama  Medical  Science  Foundation,  the

The  UABEF  made  contributions  to  the  University  of  Alabama  at  Birmingham  (UAB)  of  $4,985,000  during  the  2011  fiscal  year.  
UABEF leases certain facilities to UAB with annual rental expense of approximately $1,949,000 for 2011.  
 
An affiliation agreement documents the relationship between HSF and UAB. The operating revenues of UAB include approximately 
$24,382,000 of funding from HSF in 2011, which is used to support the educational and research activities of UAB. 
 
UAB  and  HSF  have  entered  into  an  agreement  which  established  a  common  management  group,  the  UAB  Health  System.    The 
purpose  of  this  agreement  is  to  provide  common  management  for their  existing  and  future  health  care  delivery  operations.    UAB 
contributed $6,762,000 during 2011 to the UAB Health System Board. 
 
The  South  Alabama  Medical  Science  Foundation  exists  for  the  purpose  of  promoting  education  and  research  at  the  University  of 
South Alabama.  The Foundation reimburses the University for certain administrative expenses and other related support services.  
Total amounts received for such expenses were approximately $1,008,000 for 2011. 

 

NOTE 13 - CONTINGENCIES 

A. Grants 
The State receives federal grants for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies.  Entitlement to 
these resources is generally conditional upon compliance with the terms and conditions of grant agreements and applicable federal 
regulations, including the expenditure of resources for allowable purposes. 
 
Federal  grantor  agencies  from  time  to  time  review  state  records  to  determine  whether  the  State  has  complied  with  the  terms  and 
conditions of grant agreements and federal regulations.  Any disallowance resulting from a federal audit may become a liability of the 
State but cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  It is believed that any liability resulting from a determination of noncompliance 
will not materially affect the State's financial condition.   

B. Tobacco Settlement 
As a party to a successful multi-state legal settlement with the tobacco industry, the State received $92 million in fiscal year 2011, 
$97.2 million in fiscal year 2010, $116.6 million in fiscal year 2009, $106.1 million in fiscal year 2008, $99.0 million in fiscal year 
2007, $94.6 million in fiscal year 2006, $101.9 million in fiscal year 2005, $102.6 million in fiscal year 2004, $118.6 million in 2003 
and $224.7 million in both 2002 and 2001.  This settlement money is intended to compensate the State for smoking related health care 
costs incurred by various state programs.  Because the exact amount of the future settlement amounts is not measurable, no receivable 
for these amounts is recorded in these financial statements. 

C. Litigation 
The State is a party to numerous legal proceedings that occur in the normal course of governmental operations, some of which involve 
potentially  significant  amounts.    The  lawsuits  involving  potentially  significant  amounts  are  described  below.    Other  proceedings 
involving amounts that, when aggregated, have no material effect on the accompanying government-wide financial statements, may 
have an impact on the related individual state agencies and funds.  The monetary impact, if any, of litigation resulting in adverse 
rulings is usually addressed in subsequent state budgets and modifications of state laws.  Due to the uncertainty involving the ultimate 
outcome  and  amounts  of  the  unresolved  litigation  described  below,  no  provision  for  potential  liability  has  been  recorded  in  the 
accompanying financial statements. 
 
Blaylock,  et  al.  v.  American  Tobacco  Co.,  et  al.,  filed  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  Montgomery  County  is  an  arbitration  proceeding 
concerning the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) that was negotiated with the tobacco industry in 1998.  The MSA was entered 
into as a settlement of litigation brought against the participating tobacco products manufacturers by the Attorney Generals of the 
signatory states to reimburse the states for health care expenses in treating their citizens affected by the use of tobacco products sold 
by the manufacturers.  The MSA contains a provision that allows an adjustment to reduce the payments by the tobacco industry if the 

 

131 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
MSA has been determined to be a significant factor in the loss of market share by the manufacturers.  States will not be subject to a 
reduction in their payments if it is determined that they diligently enforced their escrow statutes.  The 2003 payment has a potential 
adjustment  of  $1.2  billion  nationwide  that  could  be  applied  to  the  states  that  are  determined  not  to  have  diligently  enforced  their 
escrow statutes during 2003.  The question of whether the state was diligent will be determined by an arbitration panel consisting of 
three  retired  Article  III  federal  judges.    The  arbitration  trial  is  scheduled  to  begin  in  the  spring  of  2012  with  a  common  case 
presentation, to be followed by more than 30 individual state presentations that will be set throughout 2012 and 2013.  Alabama’s 
individual  hearing  has  not  yet  been  scheduled.    Alabama’s  potential  share  of  the  adjustment  could  be  as  much  as  $80  million  if 
Alabama loses and is deemed to have not diligently enforced its escrow statutes during 2003.  If the tobacco industry is successful in 
the adjustment for 2003, additional arbitration proceedings would be likely for subsequent years. 
 
Lynch, et al. v. State of Alabama, et al., is a class action filed in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, on March 13, 
2008.  This class action suit is brought on behalf of public school students who maintain that their civil rights have been violated by 
the manner in which Alabama’s public schools are funded.  The plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment that the property tax 
restrictions in the Alabama Constitution violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000d et seq., and the Constitution 
of the United States.  They also seek an injunction against enforcing the current property tax laws until the Governor and legislature 
enact  tax  reforms  and  adequate  funding  of  education.    The  financial  impact  is  not  determinable  at  this  time,  but  is  potentially 
significant.  A trial began in U. S. District Court on March 21, 2011 and a final order was issued on October 21, 2011, rejecting the 
plaintiffs’ claims of discrimination.  The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U. S. 11th circuit Court of appeals on November 18, 2011. 
 
The State of Alabama has been involved in settling lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the franchise tax in effect before 2000.  
The U. S. Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s franchise tax scheme unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.  
The State is continuing to negotiate settlements with corporations for potential refunds totaling $15,000,000 plus accumulated interest 
of $5 million.  The State Legislature enacted laws to remedy the significant loss of revenue.  
 
On August 14, 2009, Colonial Bank failed and was taken over by the State Banking Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.  The State of Alabama Department of Revenue entered final tax assessments totaling $154,600,000 and recorded liens 
against various entities within the Colonial Bank family of entities.  Appeals from those assessments are pending in the Administrative 
Law Division of the Department of Revenue, the Montgomery Bankruptcy Court, and in the Federal district court in Montgomery. 
 
The State of Alabama Department of Revenue is also involved in significant tax-related lawsuits or actions that challenge the legality 
of  certain  taxes  or  challenge  other  provisions  of  tax  laws  and  procedures.    Other  cases  challenge  tax  assessments  made  by  the 
Department.  These cases have a significant combined potential refund liability or reductions of assessments.   Adverse rulings in 
these cases could also reduce future revenues.  
 
Eugene Crum, Jr., et al. v. State of Alabama, et al., was an employment discrimination case filed in 1994 against various state agencies 
and the State Personnel Department.  The Crum case alleges discrimination in all aspects of employment. In March 2006, the State 
filed  a  request  to  the  Court  for  a  ruling  on  the  class  certification  issue  citing,  in  part,  the  continuing  financial  burden  that  expert 
updates and responses has placed on the State.  The Court granted the State’s “Motion for a Ruling” in May 2006.  The Court recently 
denied class certification to plaintiffs and defendants.  Any individual lawsuits remaining are not considered a significant liability to 
the state as a whole; however, any relief ordered by the court could involve sums of money above that which has been appropriated for 
the individual state agencies involved. 

NOTE 14 -  DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENTS 
The Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, as adopted in Alabama, permits the boards of the educational institutions of the 
State  to  allocate  an  amount  of  realized  and  unrealized  endowment  appreciation  as  the  boards  determine  to  be  prudent  for  donor-
restricted endowments.  The colleges’ policies are to retain the endowments realized and unrealized appreciation with the endowments 
after the spending rate distributions.  Endowments’ earnings are classified in accordance with donor restrictions and are reported in the 
component  units  as  net  assets  restricted  for  permanent  trust  –  expendable  or  non-expendable  as  appropriate.    The  Boards  of  the 
University of Alabama and University of South Alabama approved a spending rate of 5 percent of a moving three-year average of the 
fair (unit) value. The other four-year colleges have approved similar spending rate policies with rates ranging between 3 and 6 percent.  
The net endowment appreciation of the four-year colleges at September 30, 2011 was $65,166,000.

Budgetary Process 

Formulation of the budget begins with the preparation of estimates of expenditure requirements for the next fiscal year by the 
administrative  head of each budgeted agency and institution.  These estimates are submitted annually to the Executive Budget 
Office of the Finance Department on or before the first day of the third month preceding each regular session of the Legislature.  
The budget is prepared by program elements for each agency.  Requested changes in programmatic expenditures over the prior 
fiscal year must be explained, and proposed capital expenditures must be justified as required by the Executive Budget Office. 
 
The  budget  document,  as  finally  developed  by  the  Governor,  is  published  and  transmitted  to  the  Legislature  on  or  before  the 
second  legislative  day  of  each  regular  session.    For  each  agency,  comparative  summaries  of  appropriations  and  revenues  are 
presented for the prior year, current year, the agency's request for the next year, and the Governor's recommendation for the next 
year.  The recommended appropriation bills indicate the programmatic appropriation to each agency and the source of funds from 
which each appropriation is to be paid.  The Legislature then legally enacts the State budget into law through the passage of a 
number of bills as Appropriation Acts.  Some conditional appropriations are included in the Appropriation Acts.  The agencies do 
not include these conditional amounts in the original budget, unless the conditions have been met before the fiscal year begins.  
 
The  General  Fund  appropriations  were  reduced  as  a  result  of  proration  in  the  amount  of  $250  million.    Approximately  $156 
million  of  supplemental  appropriations  and  $33  million  of  conditional  and  other  appropriations  were  distributed  to  various 
agencies  from  the  General  Fund.    The  Medicaid  Agency  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health  received  supplemental 
appropriations in the amounts of $126 million and $13 million, respectively.  Some expenditures are required by law to be fully 
funded and estimated amounts are approved in the General Fund appropriation bill.  Increases to these estimated amounts do not 
require  a  new  bill  and  are  included  as  other  appropriations.  Original  appropriations  to  the  Departmental  Emergency  Fund  are 
included in the original budget. Emergency appropriations cannot exceed two percent of the total General Fund appropriation bill.  
 
The Education Trust Fund appropriations were reduced as a result of proration in the amount of $164 million. During fiscal year 
2011,  only  Veterans  Affairs  received  a  supplemental  appropriation  from  the  Education  Trust  Fund.    The  supplemental 
appropriation was $14 million.   
 
The Appropriation Acts budget by agency and program rather than by GAAP basis funds.  The State funds its budgetary activities 
under three budgetary fund groups.  The first is the General Fund, which includes many of the general operations of the three 
branches of government.  The second is the Education Trust Fund (ETF), which is restricted to funding all levels of educational 
activity in the State.  The third budgetary group is referred to in the budget documents as Earmarked Funds.  The Earmarked Funds 
group includes the operations of most governmental funds of both the primary government and the component units, as well as 
portions of some proprietary and fiduciary operations.   
 
The  Appropriation  Acts  do  not  include  a  revenue  budget.    At  the  time  of  their  passage,  estimates  prepared  by  legislative  and 
executive  branch  professional  staff  assure  the  legislature  that  adequate  revenues  will  be  available  to  meet  the  level  of 
appropriations  approved.    The  Appropriation  Acts  specify  that  in  addition  to  the  appropriations  made,  all  gifts,  grants,  or 
contributions in excess of the amount appropriated are automatically appropriated to be used for the purposes specified in the gift, 
grant, or contribution.  This includes federal funds which are included in the Earmarked Funds.  Most of the $3.3 billion increase 
in the Earmarked Funds is increased federal funds. 
 
Numerous statutes exist which restrict the use of most state revenue sources to specific uses.  The General Fund is funded by a 
wide variety of taxes, licenses, and interest income.  The ETF is funded primarily by income taxes and sales taxes.  The Earmarked 
Funds are generally funded by a combination of federal funds, local funds, and specific taxes and licenses. State law also requires 
that if revenues actually received are inadequate to fund the appropriations, then the appropriations must be prorated to the level 
that the revenues will support.  For the Budgetary Comparison Schedule, the budgeted revenues consist of the amount of budgeted 
expenditures allocated among the revenue categories in proportion to the actual amounts received.  

Budgetary Control 

The legal level of control is the agency and program specified in the Appropriation Acts.  For example, “Lab Analysis and Disease 
Control” and “Agricultural Inspection Services” are two programs within the agency of Agriculture and Industries.  Below this 
legal  level  of  control,  the  professional  management  of  the  Finance  Department,  under  the  authority  of  the  Governor’s  policy, 
exercises  budgetary  control  at  the  fund  and  object  level.    Each  agency  must  submit  an  operations  plan  detailing  planned

REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 
expenditures down to the object level, and then must follow that plan or explain why a change must be made.  Allotments of 
appropriations are made quarterly based on the plans of operations submitted by the agencies.    
 
The  Department  of  Finance  enforces  both  the  legal  level  and  the  professional  management  level  of  budgetary  control  through 
automated edits which must be complied with before making expenditures against an appropriation.  A change between objects 
within appropriations for programs (financial management level) must have the approval of the Budget Officer and the Finance 
Director. 
 
The  Budget  Management  Act  legally  authorizes  the  transfer  of  appropriations  between  programs  within  an  agency  with  the 
approval  of  the  Governor.    Any  transfers  approved  by  the  Governor  must  be  reported  to  the  Legislature.    Transfers  between 
agencies,  but  within  the  same  program,  may  be  made  pursuant  to  interagency  agreements  executed  for  the  purposes  of 
accomplishing  the  objectives  for  which  the  Legislature  made  the  appropriation.    These  interagency  agreements  must  also  be 
approved by the Governor.  Under the Budget Management Act, the Governor cannot create new budget authority; he can only 
transfer existing authority. 
 
Both the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and the statutes require a balanced budget for annual financial operations.  The Finance 
Department  monitors  revenue  projections  during  the  year  to  ensure  that  adequate  funds  will  be  available  to  meet  budgeted 
expenditures.  If cash collections do not meet budget projections, the Governor is required to prorate appropriations and restrict 
allotments to prevent an overdraft or budget deficit in any fiscal year. Within the Alabama Trust Fund, a General Fund Rainy Day 
Account  and  an  Education  Trust  Fund  Rainy  Day  Account  have  been  created  by  constitutional  amendment.    If  proration  is 
declared for the General Fund or the Education Trust Fund, then oil and gas capital payments in the Alabama Trust Fund will be 
used to fund withdrawals from the Rainy Day Accounts.  If proration is declared for the General Fund, Rainy Day withdrawals 
may not exceed the lesser of (a) ten percent of the previous fiscal year’s General Fund appropriations less the total amount of any 
prior years’ withdrawals from the account which have not been repaid to the account, or (b) the average of the estimated available 
revenue for the General Fund certified by the Finance Director and the Legislative Fiscal Officer prior to the third legislative day 
of the Regular Session.   If proration is declared for the Education Trust Fund, Rainy Day withdrawals may not exceed the lesser 
of (a) six and one-half percent of the previous fiscal year’s Education Trust Fund appropriations less the total amount of any prior 
years’  withdrawals  from  the  account  which  have  not  been  repaid  to  the  account,  or  (b)  the  average  of  the  estimated  available 
revenue  for  the  Education  Trust  Fund  certified  by  the  Finance  Director  and  the  Legislative  Fiscal  Officer  prior  to  the  third 
legislative  day  of  the  Regular  Session.  The  Rainy  Day  Accounts  must  be  replenished  within  10  years  for  the  General  Fund 
withdrawals  and  6  years  for  the  Education  Trust  Fund  withdrawals.    The  General  Fund  was  prorated  by  15%  in  2011.  The 
Education Trust Fund was prorated by 3% in 2011.  The General Fund has 9 years to pay back $162 million which was withdrawn 
in 2010, and the Education Trust Fund has 4 years to pay back $437 million which was withdrawn in 2009.  At the end of fiscal 
year 2011 there were no funds left that could be drawn from either Rainy Day Account. 

Encumbrance Accounting 

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods and services.  Encumbrance accounting is used 
as purchase orders are issued to ensure that purchase orders plus expenditures do not exceed allotment balances.  At fiscal year end 
this  control  becomes  stricter,  as  purchase  orders  plus  any  other  obligations  or  accounts  payable  incurred  against  fiscal  year 
appropriations may not exceed allotment balances. 
 
Encumbrances  are  reported  in  the  year  the  orders  are  placed  for  budgetary  purposes  in  the  Budgetary  Comparison  Schedule.  
Encumbrances are reported in the year the goods and services are received for GAAP basis financial statements. 

Lapsing of Appropriations 

All non-capital outlay appropriation balances not reserved by encumbrances or accounts payable lapse at September 30 of each 
fiscal  year.    Furthermore,  any  non-capital  outlay  appropriation  balance  not  reserved  by  encumbrances  lapses  at  November  30 
following each fiscal year.  Encumbrances remain valid for a period of one year following the end of the fiscal year.  Balances of 
encumbrances are reported on the Budgetary Comparison Schedule as expenditures.  Capital outlay appropriations for the purchase 
of land, the construction of buildings, or for the maintenance of roads and bridges of the state highway system continue until the 
completion of the project.

Budgetary Basis of Accounting and Fund Structure 

The  State  budgets  and  operates  primarily  on  the  budgetary  basis  which  approximates  the  cash  basis  with  certain  material 
exceptions.    During  the  fiscal  year,  encumbrances,  which  represent  obligations  against  current  fiscal  year  appropriations,  are 
accrued.    At  year  end,  fund  balances  are  reserved  to  accrue  expenditures  for  those  outstanding  encumbrances  and  estimated 
accounts  payable.    In  compliance  with  Amendment  26  to  the  Constitution  of  Alabama  of  1901,  the  total  reservation  may  not 
exceed the cash on hand in the State Treasury.  Therefore, at year end, cash always equals or exceeds obligations (encumbrances 
and estimated accounts payable). The Budgetary Comparison Schedule (Non-GAAP Basis) presents comparisons of the adopted 
budget with actual data on a budgetary basis.  The budget excludes funds for all entities operating outside the State Treasury, 
certain distributive accounts such as those for making distributions to local governments, and most debt service accounts.  Since 
the accounting principles used in the State’s budgetary basis of accounting differ significantly from those used to present financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP, a reconciliation of the differences is presented on the schedule.  Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 41 requires that budgetary comparison schedules be presented as RSI based on the fund, 
organization,  or  program  structure  that  the  government  uses  for  its  legally  adopted  budget  for  a  government  with  significant 
budgetary perspective differences that result in the government’s not being able to present budgetary comparisons for the general 
fund and each major special revenue fund.  The budgetary fund structure for the General Fund group and the Education Trust Fund 
group is essentially the same as the GAAP fund structure. The Earmarked Fund group does not correspond to a major GAAP fund 
and these perspective differences are included in the Budget-to-GAAP Reconciliation. The budgets of some major funds are spread 
throughout various agencies and programs in the Earmarked Fund group.  A Detail Schedule of Budget and Actual Expenditures 
appears in the Governmental Funds subsection of the Combining and Individual Fund Statements and Schedules Section of the 
CAFR.  This schedule provides detail information at the legal level of control for each individual appropriation item contained in 
the budget for all budgetary fund groups.

Ten Year Loss Development Information for State Insurance Fund 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 

The following table illustrates how the State Insurance Fund's (Fund) earned revenue (net of reinsurance) and investment income 
compare to related costs of loss (net of loss assumed by reinsurers) and other expenses assumed by the Fund as of the end of each 
of the previous ten years. The rows of the table are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's gross 
earned premiums and reported investment revenue, amounts of premiums ceded, and reported premiums (net of reinsurance) and 
reported investment revenue. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operating costs of the Fund including overhead and loss 
adjustment expenses not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the Fund's gross incurred losses and allocated loss 
adjustment expense, losses assumed by reinsurers, and net incurred losses and loss adjustment expense (both paid and accrued) as 
originally  reported  at  the  end  of  the  year  in  which  the  event  that  triggered  coverage  occurred  (called  accident  year).  (4)  This 
section of ten rows shows the cumulative net amounts paid as of the end of successive years for each accident year. (5) This line 
shows the latest reestimated amount of losses assumed by reinsurers for each accident year. (6) This section of ten rows shows 
how each accident year's net incurred losses increased or decreased as of the end of successive years. (This annual reestimation 
results from new information received on known losses, reevaluation of existing information on known losses, and emergence of 
new  losses  not  previously  known.)  (7)  This  line  compares  the  latest  reestimated  net  incurred  losses  amount  to  the  amount 
originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of losses is greater or less than originally estimated. As data 
for  individual accident  years  mature,  the  correlation between original estimates  and  reestimated  amounts  is  commonly  used  to 
evaluate the accuracy of net incurred losses currently recognized in less mature accident years. The columns of the table show data 
for successive accident years.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
Information About Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 
 

Modified Approach 

As  allowed  by  GASB  Statement  Number  34,  the  State  has  adopted  the  modified  approach  for  reporting  roadway  and  bridge 
infrastructure assets.  Under the modified approach, depreciation is not recorded.  Infrastructure costs that result in an increase in 
the capacity or an improvement in the efficiency of the infrastructure network are capitalized and added to the historical cost of the 
assets.  Costs that allow the infrastructure network to be used efficiently over the expected useful life of the assets are expensed as 
general  maintenance  costs.    Certain  maintenance  costs  that  extend  the  useful  life  of  the  assets  but  do  not  increase  capacity  or 
efficiency are classified as preservation costs.  Preservation costs are expensed and reported in lieu of a charge for depreciation 
expense.    Assets  accounted  for  under  the  modified  approach  in  fiscal  year  2011  include  approximately  10,849  miles  of  state 
maintained highways and 5,395 of state maintained bridges and culverts. 
 
In order to utilize the modified approach, Alabama is required to: 

  Maintain an asset management system that includes an inventory of eligible infrastructure assets. 
  Perform condition assessments of eligible assets and summarize the results using a measurement scale. 
  Estimate annually the amount to maintain and preserve the assets at the condition level established and disclosed by the 

State. 

  Document that the assets are being preserved approximately at or above the established condition level. 
 

Roads 

Measurement Scale 
The  Alabama  Department  of  Transportation  uses  the  International  Roughness  Index  (IRI)  to  measure  and  monitor  pavement 
conditions.  The IRI is a standard representing the perceived smoothness of pavements while traveling in passenger cars.  The 
smoothness is measured by the cumulative height the wheel of a vehicle travels vertically over a mile long section of roadway.  
For example, if the wheel of a vehicle travels vertically 1.0 inches every 0.01 miles, the IRI for that 1 mile section of roadway 
would be the sum of 100 measurements (0.01 X 100 = 1 mile)  of 1.0 inches each or 100 inches/mile.  A lower IRI measurement 
represents a smoother condition of pavement.   
 
Data  is  collected  by  route  samples  and  complete  route  assessments  when  available.    If  data  is  collected  in  route  samples,  the 
samples  are  weighted  by  route  length  to  give  system  averages.    If  data  is  collected  for  the  complete  route,  the  frequency  of 
collection is every 0.01 mile and no weighting is used in the computation of system averages.   
 
The United States Department of Transportation developed suggested values for IRI of <60 inches/mile to >220 inches/mile to 
grade the smoothness condition of the roadway.  The Alabama Department of Transportation utilizes this scale of suggested values 
in its roadway condition assessments.  The IRI scale is as follows: 
 
IRI Rating
> 170 Interstates
> 220 Other Routes

Bridges 

Measurement Scale 
ALDOT uses a weighted rating of the major structure components and the deck area of a bridge or culvert.  The GASB 34 Bridge 
Rating is a zero to ten score assigned to each component-rating category and then averaged for each bridge asset classification 
using an algorithm developed by the ALDOT Maintenance Bureau.  The algorithm uses the assessed weighted ratings, each bridge 
deck area, and the sum of all deck areas.  The ten point scale is as follows: 
 
Rating
1 - 4.99
5 - 6.99

Description
Structural elements have been seriously affected by deterioration.
Structural elements are sound but have minor deterioration.
Structural elements show negligible signs of deterioration.

Estimated and Actual Costs 

In fiscal years 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the State estimated it would need to spend $319.6, $306.0, $310.0, $320.0, and 
$277.7 million, respectively, to preserve and maintain all roadway assets and $10.0 million in each year to preserve all bridge 
assets at or above the “Established Condition Levels” presented above. The State spent $375,653,000 for roadway preservation and 
$60,306,000 for bridge preservation in fiscal year 2011. The State spent $387,793,000 for road preservation and $47,020,000 for 
bridge preservation in fiscal year 2010.  In fiscal year 2009, the State spent $316,082,000 for road preservation and $34,457,000 
for bridge preservation.  In fiscal year 2008, the State spent $265,160,000 for roadway preservation and $22,434,000 for bridge 
preservation. In fiscal year 2007, the State spent $293,253,000 for roadway preservation and $2,188,000 for bridge preservation.    
In the next fiscal year, the Alabama Department of Transportation estimates that it will need to spend approximately $334,931,000 
to preserve all roadway assets and approximately $10,000,000 to preserve all bridge assets at or above the “Established Condition 
Levels” presented above.  Condition levels are expected to continue to meet or exceed the “Established Condition Levels”.

Agency Funds

Agency Funds report assets held by the State in a purely custodial capacity (assets equal liabilities).  Agency funds typically 
involve the receipt, temporary investment, and remittance of resources to individuals, organizations or other governments.

  
 State Clearing Accounts
 Accounts for the collection and distribution of State taxes and licenses as well as amounts collected and held by courts for 
individuals.
  
 Taxes Collected for Local Governments
 Accounts for local taxes which are collected by the State as a service for local governments.  These taxes do not represent 
future revenues of the State.
  
 Payroll
 Accounts for amounts withheld from employees that are not yet distributed to outside organizations or governments.
  
 Other Agency Funds
 Are aggregated for financial reporting purposes and represent amounts held for child support payments, cash bonds, and 
numerous other amounts held for individuals and organizations outside of State government.

obligations of public corporations governed by State officials. General Obligation bonds are issued only by voter ratified amendments 
to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.
