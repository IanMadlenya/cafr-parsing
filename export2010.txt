To the Honorable Governor, 
Members of the State Legislature, and 
the Citizens of Alabama: 
 
I am pleased to submit to you the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the State of Alabama for the year ended 
September 30, 2010.  I believe the information as presented is accurate in all material respects and complies with Article IV, Section 72 
of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and Section 41-4-3(4) of the Code of Alabama 1975, as amended.  The completeness and 
fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the State’s management.  This report complies with Article V, Section 
137 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and Section 36-16-1(6) of the Code of Alabama 1975, as amended, as the financial report 
for the State Auditor, State Treasurer, and State Comptroller. 
 
 

Introduction to the Report 

 
Internal Controls 
The internal controls in the State's accounting system have been designed to comply with Alabama statutes requiring the audit of 
receipts and receivables; the determination of legality and correctness of each claim and expenditure; and that funds are appropriated, 
allotted, and on deposit in the State Treasury before any warrant is issued.  The internal controls include manual pre-audit and 
automated system edits.  As an additional control, the State Auditor's Office is responsible for a post-audit of the accounts and records 
of the Department of Finance and the State Treasurer's Office.  These internal accounting controls provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance regarding the safeguarding of assets against loss or unauthorized disposition and the reliability of the financial records from 
which the financial reports are prepared.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should not exceed 
the resulting benefits. 
  
Audit 
This CAFR has been audited by the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts.  The Examiners conducted their audit in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted  in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The Examiners' unqualified opinion appears at 
the beginning of the financial section of this report.  The State will also undergo an audit of federal programs to conform to the 
requirements of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of 
States,  Local  Governments,  and  Non-Profit  Organizations.    Information  relating  to  the  single  audit,  including  the  schedule  of 
expenditures of federal awards, and audit findings and recommendations, is issued in a separate report and will be available at a later 
date from the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 34 requires that management provide a narrative introduction, 
overview and analysis to accompany the Basic Financial Statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).  
This letter of transmittal is intended to complement MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it.  The MD&A can be found 
immediately  following  the  Independent  Auditor’s  Report.    The  MD&A  provides  an  overview  of  the  State’s  financial  activities 
addressing both governmental and business-type activities reported in the government-wide financial statements.  In addition, the 
MD&A focuses on the State’s major funds, such as the General Fund, Education Trust Fund, Alabama Trust Fund, and Unemployment 
Compensation Trust Fund.   
 
 

 

Profile of the Government 

 
 
Reporting Entity 
This report presents financial information on all of State government as a single reporting entity.  While state law allows many state 
organizations to operate largely independent of the daily central control and scrutiny of the Department of Finance, State Auditor, and 
State Treasurer, this report combines the financial data of all state organizations in order to present a comprehensive picture of state 
finances.  The numerous departments, agencies, elected officials, boards, commissions, authorities, colleges, universities, and other 
organizational units of the State are included in this report in accordance with standards established by the Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board.  These standards make a distinction between organizations which are considered to be part of the primary government 
of the State and those which are component units.  A component unit is defined as a legally separate corporate entity for which the State 
is considered to be financially accountable.  The criteria used to determine financial accountability include the appointment of a majority 
of the governing board, the ability of the State to impose its will on the organization, and the potential for the organization to be a 
financial benefit or financial burden to the State.  The State is also considered financially accountable for any organization having an 
independently appointed board if that organization is fiscally dependent on the State.  An organization is fiscally dependent if it is 
unable to adopt a budget, set rates or charges, or issue bonded debt without the approval of the State.  Component units can be reported 
as if they are a part of the primary government (“blended presentation”) if they provide services solely to the government, but most of 
the State’s component units do not and are therefore presented separately (“discrete presentation”) in these financial statements. The 
largest of the blended component units includes the Federal Aid Highway Finance Authority, State Parks Improvement Corporation, and 
the Building Renovation Finance Authority.  The major discretely presented component units are the Alabama Public School and 
College Authority, the Department of Mental Health, the Alabama Housing Finance Authority, the Alabama Water Pollution Control 
Authority, The Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board, the State Employees’ Health Insurance Board, the University of 
Alabama, Auburn University, and the University of South Alabama.  Note 1 to the financial statements provides a more complete 
description of the State’s reporting entity. 
 
Budgetary Controls 
Budgetary control is exercised through the Executive Budget Office of the Department of Finance based on the Appropriation Acts of 
the State Legislature.  Alabama's annual Appropriation Acts include legally adopted budgets for the General Fund, the Education Trust 
Fund, and other budgeted funds.  The Appropriation Acts identify the source of funding and the programmatic (functional) areas for 
which expenditures are authorized.  Both the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and the statutes require a balanced budget for annual 
financial  operations.    In  the  event  that  revenue  collections  do not  meet  budget  projections,  the  Governor  is  required  to  prorate 
appropriations and restrict allotments to prevent an overdraft in any fiscal year for which appropriations are made.  Allotments of 
appropriations are made quarterly based on plans of operations submitted by the departments and agencies.  These appropriations and 
allotments are enforced by automated edits that prevent allotments in excess of appropriations and expenditures in excess of allotments. 
Encumbrance accounting is utilized as purchase orders are issued to insure that purchase orders plus expenditures do not exceed 
allotment balances.  Controls are further tightened at fiscal year-end by verifying that the total of purchase orders plus expenditures plus 
any obligations (accounts payable) incurred against fiscal year appropriations do not exceed allotments, and remaining allotments do not 
exceed cash in the Treasury.

Cash Controls 
The State's controls on cash are fiscally very conservative.  Constitutional Amendment 26 prohibits the State Comptroller from drawing 
warrants on the State Treasury unless there is money on hand to cover those warrants.  This is more restrictive at the end of the fiscal 
year when obligations (encumbrances and accounts payable) cannot exceed the available cash balance (cash less warrants payable). This 
control is enforced by automated edits and tends to result in positive fund balances, even when generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) basis accruals are made in the financial statements.  Compliance with Amendment 26 is demonstrated in the following exhibits 
for the General Fund and the Education Trust Fund.

Cash Management 
The State Treasurer has the responsibility for the investment of cash balances.  In accordance with statutory requirements, treasury cash 
may be invested in time deposit open accounts, or demand accounts held in Alabama banks, or repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury 
securities and Agency securities. 
 
The State Treasurer has placed considerable emphasis on cash management.  In cooperation with state agencies, the receiving of funds 
into the State Treasury is expedited, with all excess funds earning interest.  Interest earnings during the 2010 fiscal year were as follows:  
 
                                      Bank Deposits 
                                      US Treasury and Agency Securities 
 
Interest income is deposited in the State's General Fund to be appropriated by the State Legislature for government operations.  In 
addition to the management of the investment of these funds, the State Treasurer initiates investments for several state agencies, with 
interest earnings being credited to those agencies.

General Fund and Education Trust Fund Balances 
The fund balances for the General Fund and the Education Trust Fund for the last five fiscal years are presented in the following table. 
The fiscally conservative nature of Amendment 26 tends to produce positive fund balances every year.  However, in 2009 the Education 
Trust Fund used the provisions of Amendment 803 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 to borrow $437.4 million from the Alabama 
Trust Fund in order to avoid deeper cuts from proration.  The full amount of the loan remains outstanding in 2010, leaving the Education 
Trust Fund with a deficit fund balance the past two years.

Economic Condition and Outlook 

 

 

 
 
Alabama’s economy exhibited signs of recovery in 2010.  This is attributable to gains in exports as well as net positive job creation. 
Alabama’s gross domestic product (ALGDP) rose by 2.2 percent.  The State’s unemployment was slightly lower than the national 
average in contrast to Alabama exceeding the national average in 2009.  The average unemployment rate for 2010 was 9.5 percent. 
There was a 1.7 percent decline in the State’s tax revenues; however, sales tax receipts have been gradually improving and registered a 
0.9 percent increase for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.  The lower tax revenues resulted in proration in both the General 
Fund and the Education Trust Fund budgets. 
  
Alabama lost 86,300 jobs during the 12-month period ending in October 2010.  All industries lost jobs except for educational and 
healthcare services, leisure and hospitality, and government.  Sectors that shed the most jobs during the year include manufacturing, 
construction, financial activities, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and information.    
 
Manufacturing sector output rose by 4.2 percent during 2010, with a significant increase of 10.8 percent in motor vehicles and parts.    
Other contributors to the increase in the manufacturing sector output include computer and electronic products which grew by 9.5 
percent and other transportation equipment by 7.8 percent.  The construction sector’s output grew by 2.2 percent in 2010.  Several major 
commercial projects previously in the pipeline cushioned the slowdown in residential and commercial construction. Wholesale trade and 
retail trade outputs rose 1.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, as sales strengthened in the latter part of 2010. 
 
According to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration, the end of the global recession in 2009 
contributed to a 27.2 percent jump in Alabama exports to $11.2 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 
2009. Exports to Canada, Alabama’s largest trade partner, slipped from $2.8 billion in 2008 to $2.6 billion in 2009, but were up 34.9 
percent for the first three quarters of 2010.  Other major export destinations for Alabama products included Germany, Mexico, China, 
Japan, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.  For the first three quarters of 2010, transportation equipment exports amounted to $3.7 billion, 
a 30.4 percent increase from the same period in 2009.  Other major exports during the first three quarters of 2010 were chemicals, 
minerals and ores, machinery, paper products, primary metals, and computers and electronic products. 
 
Alabama’s economy is expected to improve considerably in 2011 with a 3.5 percent increase in output.  Non-agricultural employment 
will experience a slight gain of  0.7 percent; however, the unemployment rate will still remain fairly high. Tax revenues are projected to 
rise 1.2 percent in fiscal year 2011 if the state continues to improve at the pace expected. Large manufacturing and services employers 
will be the major economic drivers in 2011.  These include firms in industries such as aerospace and defense (both private and the major 
government facilities), automotive, steel, utilities, and the state’s major universities.

Awards 

 

 

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for 
Excellence in Financial Reporting to the State of Alabama for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2009.  This was the twelfth consecutive year that the State has achieved this prestigious award.  In order to be awarded a 
Certificate of Achievement, a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial 
report.  This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements. 
 
A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only.  We believe that our current Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its 
eligibility for another certificate. 
 
 
 
Production of this report would not have been possible without the assistance of all state organizations which supplied financial 
information vital to the accuracy of this report.  As we strive to produce this report in future years and to further enhance its quality, the 
continued support and cooperation of all agencies remain essential.  I also wish to express my appreciation to the entire staff in the 
Division of Control and Accounts, whose daily efforts to improve the accountability of state government make the quality of this report 
possible.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
The following is a narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the State of Alabama for the fiscal year ended September 
30,  2010.    Please  consider  the  information  presented  here  in  conjunction  with  the  letter  of  transmittal,  which  is  located  in  the 
Introductory Section of this report, and the State’s financial statements, which immediately follow this discussion and analysis.  
 

 

 

Financial Highlights 

 

 

  The State’s net assets increased by $462 million during fiscal year 2010.  The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at the 
close of the fiscal year by $23.7 billion (net assets).  Of this amount, $19.4 billion was invested in capital assets (net of related 
debt), and $3.1 billion was in the Alabama Trust Fund Capital.   

  The Change in Net Assets in governmental activities was $534 million.   
  Governmental activities have $3.2 billion in investments, $2.5 billion of which is held in the Alabama Trust Fund.  
  Grant revenues increased $2.1 billion as federal stimulus money flowed into the State 
  Tax receipts were down for the second year , this time by $123 million, or 1.7 percent as the economy remained in a downturn. 
  While federal programs swelled from federal stimulus money, the low tax receipts resulted in General Fund and Education 

Trust Fund proration. 
Investment earnings were $318 million, an improvement over last year’s $259 million earnings. 

 
  The business-type activities reported net assets at year-end of $1.1 billion, a decrease of $72 million for the fiscal year.  This 

decrease was primarily from rising unemployment benefit payments.    

  The State’s total bond debt at the end of the fiscal year was $1.68 billion, an increase of $76 million, which represents the net 

difference between new issuances and payments and refundings of outstanding debt.   

  During the year the State issued $110 million in new general obligation bonds and $112 million in general obligation refunding 
bonds.  The State made payments on general obligation bonds of $26 million during the year.  The State issued $34 million in 
new revenue bonds and $27 million in refunding revenue bonds.  

  As of the close of the current fiscal year, the State’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $5.1 
billion, an increase of $375 million from last year.  Approximately $1.5 billion of the fund balance is unreserved, undesignated 
fund balance. 

  On a budgetary basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and other sources by $44 million.  
However, on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded 
revenues and other sources by $139 million.  The Budgetary Comparison Schedule in Required Supplementary Information 
reconciles these amounts and lists the accounting basis differences.  

 

Overview of the Financial Statements 

 

 

 

 

 
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the State of Alabama’s basic financial statements.  The State’s basic financial 
statements comprise three components:  1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the 
financial statements.  This report also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information in addition to 
the basic financial statements. 
 
Government-wide Financial Statements 
The government-wide financial statements provide a broad overview of the State’s financial position and activities measured in a 
manner similar to a private-sector business.  Assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are measured and reported using 
the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting.  The government-wide financial statements exclude 
fiduciary activities. 
 
The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all of the State’s assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year.  The difference 
between the State’s assets and its liabilities is its net assets.  Increases or decreases in net assets from year to year may serve as a useful 
indicator of whether the financial position of the State is improving or not. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State’s net assets changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All 
changes in net assets are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related 
cash flows.  Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal 
periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). 
 
Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the State that are principally supported by taxes and 
intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of 
 

               

16

their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities).  The governmental activities of the State include general government, 
economic development and regulation, education and cultural resources, natural resources and recreation, health- physical and mental, 
social services, protection of persons and property, and transportation.  Examples of business-type activities of the State are operation of 
the State’s system of community and technical colleges, unemployment compensation services, operation of facilities for the distribution 
and sale of alcoholic beverages, and services for shippers at the Port of Mobile. 
 
The government-wide financial statements include not only the State of Alabama itself (known as the primary government), but also 
legally separate component units for which the State is financially accountable.  The major component units include the Public School 
and College Authority, Housing Finance Authority, State Employees’ Insurance Board, Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance 
Board, Water Pollution Control Authority, Department of Mental Health, University of Alabama, Auburn University, and University of 
South Alabama.  Financial information for the component units is reported in a separate column from the financial information presented 
for the primary government.  The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and 
analysis. 
 
Fund Financial Statements 
A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that the State uses to keep track of specific sources of 
funding and spending for a particular purpose.  Fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal 
requirements.  All of the funds of the State can be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary 
funds. 
 
Governmental funds 
Most of the State’s basic services are reported in governmental funds.  The governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term 
inflows and outflows of resources of these funds and the balances of those resources available at year-end.  These funds are measured 
and reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the 
information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide 
financial statements.  By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing 
decisions.  Both the governmental fund Balance Sheet and the governmental fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in 
Fund Balances are followed by a reconciliation to the government–wide statements.  
 
The types of funds which are categorized as governmental funds are the General Fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, 
debt service funds, and permanent funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental fund Balance Sheet and in the 
governmental fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances for the General Fund, Alabama Trust Fund, 
Education Trust Fund, Public Road and Bridge Fund, Public Welfare Trust Fund, and Alabama Medicaid Fund, all of which are 
considered to be major funds.  Data from the nonmajor governmental funds are combined into a single aggregated column on the basic 
financial statements.  Individual fund data for each of the nonmajor governmental funds can be found in the combining and individual 
fund statements and schedules section of this report. 
 
Proprietary funds 
Services for which the State charges customers a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds.  The State maintains two different types 
of proprietary funds: enterprise funds and internal service funds.  Like the government-wide statements, proprietary funds use the 
accrual basis of accounting. 
 
Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements. 
These funds report activities that provide supplies and services to the general public in a manner similar to private business enterprises. 
The major enterprise funds are the Unemployment Compensation Trust, State Port Authority, Alabama College System, and the 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.  Individual fund data for each of the nonmajor enterprise funds can be found in the combining and 
individual fund statements and schedules section of this report. 
 
Internal service funds report activities that provide supplies and services to other state agencies on a cost-reimbursement basis.  These 
funds are reported as governmental activities on the government-wide financial statements. These funds provide computer services, 
information technology, telecommunications, rental of office buildings, janitorial services, building maintenance, manufacturing 
activities, and liability protection. The internal service funds are aggregated in a single column on the proprietary fund statements.  
 
Fiduciary funds 
The State acts as a trustee or fiduciary for its employee pension plans.  It is also responsible for other assets that, because of a trust 
arrangement, can be used only for the trust beneficiaries.  The State’s fiduciary activities are reported in separate Statements of 
Fiduciary Net Assets and Changes in Fiduciary Net Assets.  These funds, which include pension and other employee benefits, private-
 

17

 

 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
purpose, and agency funds are reported using accrual accounting.  The government-wide financial statements exclude fiduciary fund 
activities and balances because the resources of those funds are not available to support the State’s own programs. 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
The notes to the financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements.  They explain amounts shown in the financial 
statements and provide additional information that is essential to the fair presentation of the government-wide and fund financial 
statements.   
 
Required Supplementary Information 
In  addition  to  the  basic  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes,  this  report  also  presents  certain  required  supplementary 
information which includes (1) budgetary comparison schedule reconciling the budgetary fund balances and generally accepted 
accounting principles fund balances at fiscal year-end, (2) ten year loss development information for the State Insurance Fund, (3) a 
schedule  of  funding  progress  for  the  Employees’  Retirement  System,  (4)  a  schedule  of  funding  progress  for  the  Retired  State 
Employees’ Health Care Trust, and (5) information about infrastructure assets reported using the modified approach.   
 
Other Supplementary Information 
Other supplementary information includes combining financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor enterprise funds, 
internal service funds, fiduciary funds, and nonmajor discretely presented component units.  These funds are added together by fund 
type and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements. 
 
 

Government-wide Financial Analysis 

 
Net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position.   The State’s combined assets exceeded 
liabilities by $23.7 billion as of September 30, 2010.   
 
The largest component (82 percent) of the State’s net assets reflects its investment in capital assets, such as land, buildings, equipment, 
and infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, tunnels), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.  The State uses 
these capital assets to provide services to its citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the 
State’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must 
be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.  Capital Assets increased 
$395 million.  Of that amount $314 million was infrastructure and infrastructure construction in progress. 
 
Current and Other Assets increased $714 million, or 9.5%.  Included in that amount was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of   
$428  million and an increase in investments of $137 million.  $57 million of the investment increase was an increase in funds required 
by law to be set aside and invested for capital grants to cities and counties.   
 
Long-term liabilities increased 10.5 percent, or $238 million.  The largest components of this increase were $82 million in general 
obligation bonds, $67 million in capital leases and notes payable, and $100 million for post-employment health care benefits.  Other 
Liabilities for business-type activities increased by $263 million, or 109.5 percent, primarily because of Federal Unemployment Trust 
Fund advances reported in Due to Other Governments. 
 
Restricted net assets represent resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or legislative restrictions on 
how they may be used.  Internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets.  The State’s net assets 
that are unrelated to capital assets include $5.0 billion in restricted net assets.  Unrestricted net assets represent the remaining amount of 
net assets that may be used to meet the State’s ongoing obligations that are not funded by resources that are restricted.  The State has a 
deficit in unrestricted net assets of $677 million.  Unrestricted net assets for governmental activities are a deficit of $821 million, while 
business-type activities have a positive balance in unrestricted net assets of $144 million.

The table on the following page was derived from the government-wide Statement of Activities.  As a result of the excess of expenses 
over revenues, the State’s net assets increased by $462 million during fiscal year 2010.   Taxes provided $7.2 billion, or approximately 
33 percent, of the State’s total revenue.  Tax revenues decreased $123 million, or 1.7 percent, compared to the previous year as the 
economy was in recession for the early part of the fiscal year.  Despite the drop in tax revenues, overall revenue increased $2.4 billion, 
or 12.1%.  Operating Grants and Contributions revenue increased $2.0 billion, or 24.7 percent, because of the increase in federal grant 
receipts from the federal stimulus programs. Grants and contributions not restricted to specific programs rose from $785,000 to $40.3 
million primarily as a result of a $39.1 million federal bonus award for outstanding performance in the State’s Medicaid program.  
Investment earnings were $318 million, an improvement over last year’s $259 million.  Charges for Services revenue increased $92 
million, or 4.3 percent.   
 
The  increase  in  federal  dollars  enabled  total  expenses  to  increase  by  $1.6  billion,  or  8.1  percent  in  2010.    Spending  increased 
significantly in most areas.  Health increased $588 million, or 10.6 percent, as expenses for Medicaid surged $504 million, or 11.3 
percent.  A total of $6.1 billion, or 29 percent of all expenses, was spent on Health, which included $5 billion spent in Medicaid 
programs.  Social Services was up $386.9 million, or 19.6 percent, as high unemployment increased expenses for food assistance by 
$272.6 million and the temporary assistance  to needy families program increased $49.9 million.  Total Social Services spending was 
nearly $2.4 billion, or 11 percent of total expenses.  Transportation increased $136 million, or 12.2 percent.  General Government was 
up $84 million, or 8.6 percent.  Education spending, however, was fairly flat at a mere 0.6 percent increase.  Education spending is 
funded primarily by tax revenues, which, as discussed earlier, rose only 1.7 percent. Education and Cultural Resources spending totaled 
$6.4 billion, or 30 percent, of the State’s total expenses, down from 32.2 percent in 2009.  Economic Development and Regulation 
spending  was  down  $77  million,  or  25.2  percent  because  the  prior  year  included  major  industrial  recruit  grant  payments  to 
ThyssenKrupp and Goodyear.   
 
In business-type activities, high unemployment rates and extended benefits drove spending for Unemployment Compensation up by 
$317 million, a 31.5 percent increase.    The expenses for the Alabama College System increased by 8.2% primarily because of  
increases in student aid and scholarships.  The State Port Authority recognized a 3.3 percent savings in operating expenses  primarily 
because of furloughs for the hourly workforce and attrition.

Governmental Activities 
Total revenues for governmental activities in fiscal year 2010 were $19.7 billion.   Revenue is categorized as either program revenue, 
which is generated by the program itself or is received from another government, or general revenue.  Program revenues include charges 
for services, operating grants and contributions, and capital grants and contributions.  Operating grants and contributions along with 
taxes together accounted for 83 percent of governmental activities revenue. 
 
Program revenues totaled $11.3 billion, up from $9.8 billion the previous year.  Operating grants and contributions are the largest 
program revenues, and at $9.1 billion, make up 46 percent of total governmental revenues.  Operating grants and contributions grew 
$1.5 billion, or 20 percent compared to the previous year, due to the influx of federal stimulus funds.  Operating grants and contributions 
were up $397 million to the Education Department, largely from stimulus programs.  Grants for food assistance increased $273 million 
while Medicaid assistance was up $385 million.  About 92 percent of operating grants and 97 percent of the capital grants were received 
from the Federal government.  Capital grants and contributions increased $115 million, or 14 percent, almost all of it being federal 
support  for road and bridge construction.   
 
Charges for services decreased $136 million, or 10.1 percent, compared to the previous year.  Of that $136 million, $81.8 was due to 
one time court settlements received in 2009, while $38 million is attributable to a decrease in revenues from oil and gas leases.  Oil and 
gas lease revenues often fluctuate greatly from year to year as the commodity markets go up and down. 
 
General revenues, which include taxes, of governmental activities were $8.4 billion, an increase of 1.9 percent. Taxes were $7.2 billion, 
down from $7.3 billion the previous year.  Revenue from all tax types represents 37 percent of total governmental revenues earned 
during fiscal year 2010.  Of the $7.2 billion in tax revenues, the largest taxes were income taxes of  almost $3.0 billion and sales and use 
taxes of $2.1 billion. Sales and use taxes were up 1.4 percent, while income taxes decreased 4.4 percent, reflecting the downturn in the 
economy.

Total operating expenses for governmental activities in fiscal year 2010 were $18.8 billion.  Expenses for governmental activities are 
grouped by functional area.  The two largest functional areas were (1) Education and Cultural Resources and (2) Health.  These two 
areas  together accounted for 67 percent of the governmental activities expenses for fiscal year 2010.  Social Services accounted for 12 
percent of the governmental activities expenses.  Overall expenses increased by $1.2 billion, or 7 percent.   
 
Education spending increased 0.6 percent, or $40.7 million, as the decrease in income tax revenue forced constitutionally mandated 
proration of 9.5 percent of the budget in the Education Trust Fund.  Education and Cultural Resources now makes up 34  percent of 
governmental activity expenses, down from 36 percent last year.  Within Education and Cultural, 90 percent is support for local school 
systems and state universities.  Support for local school systems increased $136 million, or 3.0 percent, support for universities 
decreased $15 million, or 1.4 percent, and support for most other programs decreased slightly as well. 
 
Health accounted for 33 percent of governmental activity spending, up slightly from 32 percent last year.  The Medicaid program 
accounts for 82 percent of Health spending and the Department of Public Health accounts for 11 percent.

Business-type Activities 
 
The largest business-type activity is the Alabama College System, which accounts for 85.6 percent of business-type net assets.  The 
other major business-type activities are the Alabama Port Authority, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and the Unemployment 
Compensation Trust.  In fiscal year 2010 the net assets of business-type activities decreased by $72 million.  The largest change 
occurred in the Unemployment Compensation Trust fund, where the decrease in net assets was $131 million.  The high unemployment 
rates and federal extended benefits increased unemployment benefit payments by $314 million.  The Unemployment Compensation 
Trust Fund was in a borrowing status from the Federal Bureau of Public Debt, and the State did not receive any interest income during 
fiscal year 2010. The second largest change occurred in the Alabama College System, where the increase in net assets was $72 million.  
The Alabama College System received $391 million in operating grants and contributions including federal stimulus funds. Also, the 
Alabama College System receives most of the Transfers In that are reported in the business-type activities.  Most of these transfers are 
from the Education Trust Fund as mandated by the legislature in the appropriation acts.  Revenues of business-type activities totaled 
$2.2  billion,  an  increase  of  46.2  percent.  This  large  increase  was  primarily  due  to  increased  rates  charged  to  employers  for 
unemployment compensation, and federal stimulus funds for the colleges.  Most of this revenue was self-generated program revenues; 
only $24.7 million of the $2.2 billion revenues came from general revenues. The program revenues consisted of $1.0 billion of charges 
for services, a 29.1 percent increase, and $1.2 billion of operating grants and contributions, a 76.5 percent increase.  The 76.5 percent 
increase was primarily federal stimulus funds.   The total expenses for business-type activities were $2.6 billion, up 16.9 percent, 
primarily because of unemployment benefit payments. 
 
 

Financial Analysis of the State’s Funds 

 

Governmental Funds 
 
The focus of the State’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable 
resources.  Such information is useful in assessing the State’s financing requirements.  In particular, unreserved fund balance may serve 
as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
At the end of fiscal year 2010, the governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $5.1 billion.  Of this total amount, 
$3.5  billion  is  reserved  and  is  not  available  for  spending  because  it  has  already  been  legally  dedicated  for  various  contractual 
commitments, court settlements, constitutional restrictions, and other purposes.  The largest reserved amount of $3.1 billion is for 
Alabama Trust Capital.  The Alabama Trust Fund originally was a permanent fund, but is now a special revenue fund because of  
Amendment 666 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 which allows spending of principal equal to the previous year’s unrealized 
gains.  An additional $394 million of governmental fund balance has been reserved for a variety of purposes while $154 million of 
governmental  funds  have  been  designated  for  various  capital  projects  and  debt  service,  leaving  $1.5  billion  as  unreserved  and 
undesignated.   
 
The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the State.  At the end of the current fiscal year, unreserved fund balance of the 
General Fund was $77 million, and reserved fund balance was $5 million.  Revenues for the General Fund decreased $151 million, or 11 
percent, as taxes decreased $49 million, court settlements decreased $53 million, other revenue decreased $40 million, and investment 
income decreased $11 million.   One time revenues were the cause of the decrease in both court settlements and other revenues as the 
State benefitted in 2009 from a $52 million drug settlement and a $40 million receipt from a component unit.  Expenditures for the 
General Fund decreased $219 million, or 15 percent.  Health expenditures decreased $88 million, as overall grant payments related to 
Medicaid programs decreased $103 million.  Medicaid hospital care program grants decreased $63 million.  The Medicaid nursing home 
care program grants decreased $82 million.  The Medicaid Pharmaceutical program was up $30 million.  A portion of the Medicaid 
decrease in hospital care program and nursing home care program grant payments was the result of  payments being made from stimulus 
funds in the Medicaid Fund and the Alabama Health Care Trust Fund, a nonmajor governmental fund.  Protection of Persons and 
Property expenditures decreased $122 million, with $101 million of decrease being spent with stimulus funds in nonmajor governmental 
funds for correctional facility operations.  Spending on General Government decreased $13 million.  Spending in most general 
government departments was relatively unchanged from the previous year, most of the decline was in employee salaries and benefits of 
$9 million and professional services of $3 million.  Across all functional categories General Fund spending for supplies and materials 
was up 8 percent while all other categories were down.  The largest decrease was in spending for grant payments which was down 21%. 
Spending for employee salaries and benefits was down 16% as departments shifted payroll costs to other funds.  Due to Other Funds 
increased $158 million to a balance of $168 million. A large portion, $162 million, is a loan owed to the Alabama Trust Fund.  The 
money was borrowed to alleviate revenue shortages in accordance with Amendment 803 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
The Education Trust Fund (ETF) is the largest governmental fund of the State.  Revenues credited to the ETF are used for the support, 
maintenance, and development of public education in Alabama, debt service and capital improvements related to educational facilities, 
and other functions related to educating the State’s citizens.  Programs and agencies supported by the ETF include K-12 education, 
public library services, performing and fine arts, scholarship programs, the State’s education regulatory departments, and two and four-
year colleges and universities.  Funding from the ETF is also provided to non-state organizations that provide educational services to the 
people of Alabama, including the arts, disease counseling and education, and youth development.  Various tax sources are allocated to 
the ETF, the largest of which are income tax, sales tax, utility tax, and use tax.  Tax revenues in the ETF for fiscal year 2010 were down 
$90 million, or 2 percent as compared to fiscal year 2009.  Individual income tax revenues were down by $425 million, sales and use tax 
revenues were up by $72 million, and corporate income tax revenues were up by $279 million.  Expenditures, as limited by the budget, 
were down 8 percent, or $429 million.  A large portion of the decrease, $282 million, was in financial assistance to local school systems, 
and support for state universities decreased $108 million.  The ETF transferred out $381 million, with the largest of these transfers going 
to supplement operations of the Alabama College System, a major Proprietary fund.  The Alabama College System received $339 
million in transfers as mandated by the legislature in the appropriations acts.   Due to Other Funds in the ETF of $444 million includes 
$437 million owed to the Education Rainy Day account in the Alabama Trust Fund.  The ETF fund balance decreased $23 million to a 
deficit of $245 million, primarily due to a reduction in cash of $17 million.     
 
The Alabama Trust Fund consists of income from the sale or lease of rights for offshore exploration and drilling for oil and gas off the 
Alabama coast, as well as investment income earned on the accumulated capital.  Revenues from royalties and other payments related to 
the production of oil and gas decreased by $40 million in 2010.  Investment income increased from a $170 million gain to a $256 
million gain, an increase of $86 million. Various amendments to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 require that Alabama Trust 
income be used to support the General Fund, Forever Wild Land Trust, and a variety of state and local capital projects and debt service. 
In compliance with constitutional requirements, $203 million was transferred out to support these other funds.  The asset account Due 
From Other Funds increased by $162 million as an interfund loan was made to the General Fund under the authority of Amendment 803 
to the Constitution Alabama of 1901.  During the 2010 fiscal year, the amount constitutionally reserved for Trust Capital increased by 
$191 million, a 7 percent increase.   
 
Medicaid accounts for a portion of the Medicaid program that is funded by Federal revenues and other non-state revenue sources.   
Federal revenues increased 11 percent, or $406 million.  Overall, revenues were up 9 percent, or $373 million.  Expenditures increased 
10 percent or $394 million with the largest increase being a $306 million increase in hospital care program.  An increase in hospital care 
program expenditures was due to a shift in payments from the General Fund to stimulus funds and due to a change in hospital 
reimbursement methodology in accordance with Act 2009-549.  Nursing Home Care increased $104 million with most of the increase 
being due to payments being made in the General Fund last year, but were shifted to the Medicaid fund this year.  Alternative care 
programs declined $79 million or 18 percent.  Accounts Receivable increased $23 million due to a one time final reimbursement due 
from the Alabama Hospital Association to settle the old hospital reimbursement plan (Prepaid Health Plan). The net change in fund 
balance for Medicaid was $46 million, increasing the total fund balance to $38 million from a deficit of $8.35 million in the prior year. 
 
The Public Road and Bridge Fund is the general operating fund of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and receives all state 
revenues for that department, including all federal aid reimbursements.  Amendment No. 93 (as amended by Amendment No. 354) to the 
Constitution of Alabama of 1901 provides that monies derived from any fee, excise or license taxes levied by the State on motor fuels 
shall be expended for the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of public highways and bridges; the cost of 
highway rights-of-way; the payment of highway obligations; the cost of traffic regulations; and the expense of enforcing state traffic and 
motor vehicle laws.  Federal revenues increased by 16 percent, or $124 million over 2009.  Expenditures declined $19 million, or 1 
percent.  Cash balance rose from $318 million to $425 million.  The fund balance increased by $54 million to a total fund balance of 
$473 million.  $79 million of that fund balance is committed in the form of encumbrances for various contracts and purchase orders, $26 
million is in inventory of materials on hand, and $46 million is reserved by statute for replacement of equipment.  The remaining $322 
million is unreserved but the management of the DOT plans to use the money to cover commitments already made for construction and 
maintenance contracts.   
 
The Public Welfare Trust Fund is used to account for a broad range of social, protective, and financial assistance programs for citizens.  
This is the major operating fund of the Department of Human Resources.  89 percent of the revenue is from federal funds, but is 
supplemented by whiskey tax and a portion of the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board profits, sales tax, franchise tax, and beer 
tax.  Overall spending rose $371 million, or 23 percent.  Spending on various children’s programs rose $26 million, or 7 percent.  The 
economic downturn created a huge increase in demand for food assistance, as spending increased $274 million, a 27 percent increase.  
Expenses for the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program rose $49 million, an increase of 76 percent.  $2 billion was spent in 
the fund in 2010,  and the fund balance at year end is $83 million, a decrease of $1 million.  The small fund balance is normal for this 
fund, since the Federal Cash Management Improvement Act does not allow the State to draw money and hold it for more than a few 
days.

The Education Trust Fund had a negative fund balance at September 30, 2010.  This is not typical for the State’s major governmental 
funds  because  the  fiscally  conservative  nature  of  the  State’s  controls  generally  results  in  positive  fund balances. Constitutional 
Amendment 26 requires the State to have on hand at year end in each budgeted fund enough cash to cover all outstanding warrants and 
any remaining unspent obligations (encumbrances and accounts payable).  The Education Trust Fund had a negative fund balance at 
September 30 resulting from the interfund loan owed to the Alabama Trust Fund.  The accrual of taxes receivable in the General Fund 
and Education Trust Fund almost always assures a positive fund balance.  The Public Road and Bridge Fund retains enough cash to 
cover their outstanding construction contracts and commitments so that fund historically has a large fund balance. 
 
Proprietary Funds 
 
The State’s proprietary fund financial statements provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial 
statements, but in more detail.  During the fiscal year, total net assets for all enterprise funds declined by $72 million.   
 
In fiscal year 2010, the net assets of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund were $152.8 million in deficit, a decreased of   
$130.5 million.  The State Unemployment Insurance tax rate was raised effective January 1, 2010. Average tax rates per employee per 
year ranged from $64 to $512 in 2009.  In 2010, the rates increased to $172 to $664, per employee per year.  The increase in 
Unemployment Insurance tax rate brought in additional $190.9 million revenues comparing to the year before, a 90.4 percent increase.  
However, due to elevated unemployment compensation claims and the extension of unemployment benefits, the unemployment benefit 
payments were $1.3 billion dollars in 2010, an increase of $314 million, a 31.4 percent increase. The State borrowed funds from the 
Federal Government to pay benefits and still owed the Federal Government $283 million for advances at year-end. 
 
The net assets of the State Port Authority decreased by $8 million to $318 million.  Operating revenues have shown a modest increase, 
to $106 million from $103 million the prior year, a 3 percent increase, resulting from a number of factors.  The McDuffie Coal Terminal 
experienced increased revenues because of the strong market for metallurgical coal and the Terminal Railway benefited from significant 
volumes of grain shipped through the leased grain facility.   However, the State Port Authority has $364 million in revenue bonds 
payable.  The interest paid during fiscal year 2010 was $13 million.  The current principal portion of this debt is $8 million.  $162 
million of this debt has variable interest rates indexed to LIBOR.  The economy has a significant effect on the State Port Authority’s 
interest expense as well as its operating revenues. 
 
The Alabama College System’s net assets increased $72 million in 2010, primarily because of an increase in federal grants including 
stimulus funds.  Grants increased from $296 million in fiscal year 2009 to $391 million in fiscal year 2010, a 32 percent increase. 
 
The net assets of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board declined by $3 million in fiscal year 2010, resulting in a $13 million deficit. 
The Board is required by law to distribute all of its profits and cannot own real property; therefore, net assets generally will remain 
negative.  
 

Budgetary Highlights 

 

General Fund 
 
The original budget for the General Fund was decreased by a net of $56 million during fiscal year 2010.  Expenditures were decreased 
by $23 million and Transfers Out decreased by $33 million, and the increases and decreases are reflected in the final budget on the 
Budgetary Comparison Schedule.  12 percent proration was declared in April 2010 because cash collections were not meeting budget 
projections.  This decreased the budget by $184 million.  The Department of Corrections was cut by $37 million and the Medicaid 
Agency was cut by $42 million.  Then in September 2010 the budget was increased by $31 million as a result of a 2 percent reduction in 
proration because of the remaining cash close to year-end.  
 
There were significant budgetary variances between the final budget and actual results.  Unexpended and reverted appropriations from 
fiscal year 2010 were reappropriated to fiscal year 2011; therefore, many agencies did not spend all of their appropriations during fiscal 
year 2010.  The Medicaid Agency has the largest carryover of $35 million to fiscal year 2011. The Department of Public Safety, the 
Legislature, Department of Corrections, Department of Economic and Community Affairs, and the Department of Finance have $7 
million, $6 million, $5 million, $5 million, and $3 million, respectively.  These funds will be needed in the future because federal 
stimulus funds will have been expended and projections for State revenues are not improving. 
 
There were budget increases to various agencies as a result of supplemental appropriations which totaled $101 million. The Department 
of Corrections received $52 million of this supplemental appropriation for correctional facility operations. The largest expenditures for 
correctional facilities are correctional officer salaries and benefits, and medical care for prisoners.  The Medicaid Agency received $42 
million of this supplemental appropriation.  The Medicaid Agency uses these funds to match the federal grants for Medicaid programs.

Capital Asset and Debt Administration 

 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
Conditional and other appropriations were approximately $3 million to various agencies.  Conditional amounts are not included in the 
budget until the conditions have been met.  Some expenditures are required by law to be fully funded, and estimated amounts are 
approved in the General Fund appropriation bill.  Increases to these estimated amounts do not require a new bill and are included as 
other appropriations. Emergency appropriations of $2 million are included in the original budget and are included in the budgeted 
amounts as Other on the Budgetary Comparison Schedule. Emergency appropriations cannot exceed two percent of the total amount 
appropriated.  The annual budget was decreased by $6 million as a result of capital project appropriations for the Department of 
Corrections.  On a budgetary basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues and other sources by $44 million.  
However, on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, General Fund expenditures and other uses exceeded revenues 
and other sources by $139 million.  The Budgetary Comparison Schedule in Required Supplementary Information reconciles these 
amounts and lists the accounting basis differences. 
 
 

 

 

Capital Assets 
 
At the end of fiscal year 2010 the State had invested $20.5 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, in a broad range of capital assets 
(see the table below).  Depreciation charges for the fiscal year totaled $146 million.

As allowed by GASB Statement No. 34, the State has adopted the modified approach for reporting roadway and bridge infrastructure 
assets. Under the modified approach, depreciation is not recorded.  Infrastructure costs that result in an increase in the capacity or an 
improvement in the efficiency of the infrastructure network are capitalized and added to the historical cost of the assets.  Costs that 
allow the infrastructure network to be used efficiently over the expected useful life of the assets are expensed as general maintenance 
costs.  Certain maintenance costs that extend the useful life of the assets but do not increase capacity or efficiency are classified as 
preservation costs.  Preservation costs are expensed and reported in lieu of a charge for depreciation expense.  
 
Extensive project documentation is required to meet various federal and state guidelines concerning the construction of infrastructure.  
The completeness of this documentation affects the timing of project capitalization.  The State capitalizes infrastructure when all costs 
for a project are incurred and all project documentation is satisfactorily completed, filed, and accepted with the appropriate entities.  
Projects  that  meet  the  cost  and  documentation  criteria  are  closed,  and  appropriate  entries  are  made  to  adjust  the  Infrastructure 
Construction in Progress and Infrastructure asset accounts annually.  Due to the documentation requirements, there can be substantial 
time lags between the date a project is put into service on the State’s roadway network and the date the project is capitalized.  A 
significant portion of Infrastructure Construction in Progress consists of projects that have been put into service and maintenance costs 
could have been incurred.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
 
The State uses the International Roughness Index (IRI) to measure and monitor pavement conditions.  The IRI is a standard representing 
the perceived smoothness of pavements while traveling in passenger cars.  A lower IRI measurement represents a smoother condition of 
pavement.  The United States Department of Transportation developed suggested values for IRI of <60 inches/mile to >220 inches/mile 
to grade the smoothness condition of the roadway.  A range of 60 to 94 is considered “Good” condition, with negligible maintenance 
required, and a range of 95-119 for Interstate Highways or 95-170 for non-interstate highways is considered “Fair”, requiring routine 
maintenance such as pavement patching.  The weighted average rating of Alabama’s roads was 79.24, which exceeds the State’s goal.  
 
The State maintains 5,368 bridges and culverts.  The State rates the major structural components and deck area of the bridge or culvert 
on a scale of one to ten and assigns a weighted rating to the bridge or culvert.   The State expects those bridges and culverts to be 
maintained at a rating within the range of 5 - 6.99, which is considered “satisfactory,” meaning the structural elements are sound but 
have minor deterioration.  The actual weighted average rating for the most recent condition assessment was 6.60, in the upper end of the 
satisfactory range.  
 
In fiscal years 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the State estimated it would need to spend $306.0, $310.0, $320.0, $277.7, and  
$247.1 million, respectively, to preserve and maintain all roadway assets and $10.0 million in each year to preserve all bridge assets at 
or above the “Established Condition Levels” presented above.   The State spent $387,793,000 for roadway preservation and $47,020,000 
for bridge preservation in fiscal year 2010.  In fiscal year 2009, the State spent $316,082,000 for roadway preservation and $34,457,000 
for  bridge  preservation.  In  the  next  fiscal  year,  the  Alabama  Department  of  Transportation  estimates  that  it  will  need  to  spend 
approximately $319,568,000 to preserve all roadway assets and approximately $10,000,000 to preserve all bridge assets at or above the 
“Established Condition Levels” presented above.  Even though actual spending for bridge preservation fell below estimated, condition 
levels are expected to continue to meet or exceed the “Established Condition Levels”.   
 
More detailed information about the State’s capital assets is presented in Note 3 to the financial statements and in the Required 
Supplementary Information section. 
 
 
Long-term Debt 
 
The only method under which general obligation debt can be incurred is by amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.  The 
debt prohibition does not apply to debts incurred by separate public corporations functioning as State instrumentalities.  The revenue 
bonds issued by these corporations are limited obligations of the corporation, not general obligations of the State, and the full faith and 
credit of the State is not pledged for their repayment.  Certain revenues, usually earmarked taxes or revenues generated from the project 
financed, are pledged for the payment of the debt.  Some of these corporations are blended with the primary government and some are 
reported discretely.  The State and its component units issue serial and term bonds and capital appreciation bonds.  Alabama has 
traditionally received high bond ratings from both Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investors Service.  Currently, an     
exception is the upper medium bond ratings for the Tobacco Settlement Revenue Bonds issued by the Alabama Twenty-first Century 
Authority, a component unit of the State.  Also, Fitch Ratings Ltd and Standard and Poor’s Corporation lowered the bond ratings for  the 
State Port Authority to BBB+ in September 2009.  Moody’s withdrew their rating for the State Port Authority in June 2009.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 

Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates 

 

 

On February 28, 2011 the new governor declared 3 percent proration for the fiscal year 2011 Education Trust Fund budget because of 
revenue shortfalls.  Furthermore, he announced plans to declare 15 percent proration in the State General Fund, after first working with 
the Legislature for supplemental appropriations to protect priority agencies that provide necessary and critical services.   With one time 
federal stimulus money now depleted, Alabama is left with the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in both state budgets.  The 
Education Trust Fund budget has a $165 million shortfall while the General Fund budget has a $110 million shortfall. Agencies will 
have to revise their operating plans including plans for employee layoffs.  State agencies normally receive allotments of 25 percent each 
quarter.  The first two quarters were not cut; therefore, all of the shortfall will be in the last half of the fiscal year.  Tax collections are 
down and the future economic condition is uncertain for the nation.  This economic recession will continue to impact Alabama.  The 
State’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, at 9.3 percent in January 2011, was above December 2010’s rate of 9.1 percent but  was 
below the year-ago rate of 10.3 percent.

Some of the State's revenues will be collected after year-end, but
     are not available soon enough to pay for the current period's
     expenditures, and therefore are deferred in the funds.
Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs
     of certain activities, such as insurance and information technology, 
     to individual funds.  The assets and liabilities of the internal
     service funds are included in governmental activities in the
     statement of net assets.
Long-term liabilities are not due and payable in the current period
     and therefore are not reported in the funds.

Long-term bonded debt is not due and payable in the current period and

     premiums, unamortized loss, deferred debt financing costs, and interest payable
     are not reported in the funds.  However, these amounts are included in the
     Statement of Net Assets.  This is the total effect of these balances on the statement.

STATE OF ALABAMA
RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES 
IN FUND BALANCES OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES 

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010
(Amounts in Thousands)
Net Change in Fund Balances for Governmental Funds
Governmental funds report capital outlay as expenditures.  However, in the Statement of Activities,
     the cost of those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense.
     This is the amount by which capital outlays exceeded depreciation in the current period.
          Capital Outlay
          Depreciation Expense

446,570
(75,490)

In the Statement of Activities, only the gain (loss) on the sale of assets is reported, whereas in the
     governmental funds, the proceeds from the sale increase financial resources.  Thus, the change
     in net assets differs from the change in fund balance by the cost of the assets sold.
Some capital additions were financed through capital leases.  In the governmental funds, a capital
     lease arrangement is considered a source of financing, but in the statement of net assets, the
     lease obligation is reported as a liability.
In the Statement of Activities, the change in the balance of inventories is expensed, whereas in 
     the governmental funds, the change in the balance of inventories is adjusted to reserved  
     fund balance. 
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current financial resources are not
     reported as revenues in the funds.
Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain activities, such as 
     insurance and information technology, to individual funds.  The net revenue (expense) of the 
     internal service funds is reported with governmental activities.
Capital assets reassigned to internal service funds from the general government are reported in  
    internal service funds as transfers in, but in the Statement of Activities such interfund
    activity is eliminated. 

Long-term debt principal repayment is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but the repayment 
     reduces long-term debt in the Statement of Net Assets.

          Bond premium

Certain expenditures are reported in the funds.  However, they either increase or decrease long-term
     liabilities reported on the Statement of Net Assets and have been eliminated from the Statement 
     of Activities.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A. Reporting Entity 
As  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  these  financial  statements  present  the  State  of  Alabama  (the  primary 
government) and its component units.  Component units are legally separate organizations ("public corporations") for which the 
primary  government  is  financially  accountable.    Generally,  the  primary  government  is  financially  accountable  if  it  appoints  a 
voting  majority  of  the  organization's  board  and  it  can  either  1)  impose  its  will  on  the  organization,  or  2)  there  is  a  financial 
benefit/burden  relationship.    If  the  primary  government  does  not  control  the  board,  it  may  be  financially  accountable  if  the 
organization is fiscally dependent on the State.  Organizations making up the primary government and its component units are 
summarized in the following paragraphs. 

1. Primary Government 
All  state  departments,  agencies,  elected  officials,  boards,  commissions,  authorities,  committees,  halls  of  fame,  educational 
institutions,  and  other  state  organizations  (hereafter  referred  to  as  "agencies")  which  are  not  legally  separate  are,  for  financial 
reporting purposes, part of the primary government.  All agencies and funds that operate from within the State Treasury, except 
those listed later as component units, are part of the primary government.  The following non-Treasury agencies operate largely 
independent of the control of the State Comptroller, State Auditor, and State Treasurer, but lack the corporate powers to make 
them legally separate and are therefore part of the primary government: 
 
 Alabama College System  
Alabama Fire College 
Alabama Technology Network 
Athens State University 
Aviation Hall of Fame 
Cahawba Advisory Committee 
Commercial Mobile Radio Service Board 
Dental Examiners Board 
Dental Scholarships Awards Board 
Gorgas Memorial Board 
Alabama Industrial Development and Training Institute 
 Marion Military Institute 
Medical Examiners and Licensure Commission  
Motor Sports Hall of Fame 
Optometric Scholarships Awards Board  
Optometry Board 
Pharmacy Board 
Pilotage Commission 
Podiatry Board 
School of Fine Arts 
St. Stephens Historical Commission 
State Port Authority 
Women's Hall of Fame 

2. Blended Component Units 
Blended component units are legally separate but they exist solely to provide services (usually financing) exclusively to the State.  
Because of this close relationship, they are blended with and reported as though they are a part of the primary government.  All 
references  in  the  financial  statements  or  elsewhere  in  these  notes  to  the  term  "primary  government"  will  encompass  both  the 
primary government and the blended component units. 
 
The following blended component units were created for the purpose of financing capital expenditures for the State.  Each issues 
revenue bonds that are limited obligations of the component unit.  Their boards consist of state officials and specific state revenues 
are pledged for bond repayment.  Those marked with a † are currently inactive and had no financial balances or activity in the past 
fiscal year.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
 
Agriculture Markets and Coliseum Authority † 
Corrections Institution Finance Authority 
Federal Aid Highway Finance Authority 
Highway Authority † 
Industrial Access Road and Bridge Authority † 
Toll Road, Bridge and Tunnel Authority † 
Judicial Building Authority 
Alabama Trade School and Junior College Authority † 
Public Health Care Authority 
Gulf State Park Authority† 
 
 
The Building Renovation Finance Authority has the same characteristics as those in the previous paragraph, but has the added 
responsibility of operating, maintaining, and renting buildings in the capitol complex that are occupied by state departments. 
 
The State Parks System Improvement Corporation renovates, improves, maintains, and constructs assets belonging to the State 
Parks System.  The six members of the Corporation are state officials. 
 
The Forensic Science Bond Authority has the power to acquire, construct, and equip laboratories and other facilities for the State 
Department of Forensic Sciences.  The four members of the Authority are state officials.  The Authority had no financial activity 
in the past fiscal year. 
 
The Alabama State Parking Deck Authority has the authority to sell bonds, operate, maintain, and rent space in a parking deck on a 
block in the capitol complex.  The Authority has remained inactive since the enabling legislation was passed. 
 
The  Educational  Television  Foundation  Authority  exists  to  receive,  invest,  and  expend  donated  moneys  for  the  purpose  of 
promoting the growth and development of educational television.  The Authority consists of thirteen members who are appointed 
by the Alabama Public Television Commission.  As a non-profit public corporation, the Authority provides financing flexibility 
that the Commission, as part of the primary government, would not otherwise have. 

3. Discretely Presented Component Units 
Discretely presented component units are organizations, which are legally separate and do not exist to provide services exclusively 
to the primary government.  Providing services to the citizens of the state is not considered the same as providing services to the 
primary  government  institution.    Financial  information  for  discretely  presented  component  units  is  segregated  on  the  financial 
statements and the notes in the "Component Unit" columns in order to emphasize that they are legally separate. 
 
Most  of  the  discretely  presented  component  units  have  boards  that  are  controlled  by  the  primary  government  through  the 
appointment  of  a  majority  of  the  board  members.    The  State  has  been  determined  to  be  financially  accountable  for  each 
organization  because  it  can  impose  its  will  on  each  organization.    Unless  otherwise  noted,  financial  accountability  for  each 
organization described below exists at least in the ability of the State to modify the component unit's budget.  Other manifestations 
of financial accountability may also exist.  
 
For discretely presented component units whose boards are not controlled by the State, the organization has been determined to be 
fiscally dependent on the State.  Unless otherwise noted, fiscal dependency exists at a minimum in the State’s ability to modify the 
component unit’s budget.  Other manifestations of fiscal dependency may also exist. 
 
When audited financial statements for a discretely presented component unit exist, the address at which such financial statements 
can  be  obtained  is  included  in  the  following  paragraphs  describing  each  component  unit.    For  all  other  discretely  presented 
component units, complete financial statements may be obtained from the State of Alabama, Office of State Comptroller, RSA 
Union Building, Suite 206, Montgomery, AL  36130-2602. 
 
The  Water  Pollution  Control  Authority  operates  a  revolving  loan  fund  to  aid  municipalities  in  financing  the  construction  of 
wastewater treatment facilities.  A five-member board of directors made up of ex officio members governs the Authority.  Audited 
financial  statements  of  the  Authority  may  be  obtained  from  the  Alabama  Department  of  Environmental  Management,  1400 
Coliseum Boulevard, Montgomery, AL  36130.

The  Alabama  Drinking  Water  Finance  Authority  operates  a  revolving  loan  fund  to  aid  local  governments  in  financing  the 
construction of sanitary drinking water facilities.  A five-member board of directors made up of ex officio members governs the 
Authority.    Audited  financial  statements  of  the  Authority  may  be  obtained  from  the  Alabama  Department  of  Environmental 
Management, 1400 Coliseum Boulevard, Montgomery, AL  36130. 
 
The Department of Mental Health provides mental health services to the people of Alabama.  The Governor of the State and the 
commissioner  of  the  Department  constitute  a  public  corporation  and  are  advised  by  a  sixteen-member  board  of  trustees.    The 
commissioner  and  ten  of  the  board  members  are  appointed  at  the  discretion  of  the  Governor.    The  Mental  Health  Finance 
Authority exists to provide financing services to the Department, is therefore a blended component unit of the Department, and is 
included in all amounts reported for Mental Health. 
 
The  Crime  Victims  Compensation  Commission  awards  compensation  for  economic  losses  arising  from  criminal  conduct  and 
works to change laws to benefit crime victims.  The Commission consists of three members who are appointed by the Governor. 
 
The Tennessee Valley Exhibit Commission was created to operate a public exhibit based primarily on the history of and ongoing 
activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority and various other public entities involved in energy research and development.  The 
sixteen-member Commission is appointed by the Governor.  The building which housed the exhibit has been sold and the board is 
no longer actively operating but it has not been legally dissolved by the legislature.  
 
The State Industrial Development Authority issues bonds and uses the proceeds to make grants to local industrial development 
boards.  All members of the Authority are elected or appointed state officials. 
 
The Alabama Education Foundation encourages donations of money for local school systems and invests the money for the benefit 
of  each  local  system.    The  Foundation  is  governed  by  a  twelve-member  board  that  is  made  up  of  state  officials  and  other 
individuals appointed by state authorities. 
 
The Supercomputer Authority operates a supercomputer for the use of educational and governmental research institutions, private 
businesses, and individuals.  The eleven directors of the Authority are appointed by state officials. 
 
The  Public  Education  Employees’  Health  Insurance  Board  operates  a  health  insurance  plan  for  employees  of  public  school 
systems, state junior colleges, colleges, universities, and related education administrative employees.  The State does not appoint a 
majority of the Board but the Board is fiscally dependent on the State.  Audited financial statements of the board may be obtained 
at 201 South Union Street, Montgomery, AL  36104-0001. 
 
The  State  Employees’  Insurance  Board  operates  health  insurance  plans  for  state  employees  and  for  employees  of  local 
governments.    The  State  does  not  appoint  a  majority  of  the  Board  but  the  Board  is  fiscally  dependent  on  the  State.    Audited 
financial statements of the board may be obtained at Suite 200, 201 South Union Street, Montgomery, AL  36104. 
 
The boards of the four-year colleges of the State, except for the University of Alabama, are appointed by the State.  Those colleges 
are:  Alabama  A&M  University,  Alabama  State  University,  Auburn  University,  Jacksonville  State  University,  University  of 
Montevallo, University of West Alabama, University of North Alabama, University of South Alabama, and Troy University.  The 
University of Alabama board of trustees is not controlled by the State, but the University is subject to budgetary control by the 
State.  The  Alabama  Shakespeare  Festival, Inc.,  the  Crimson  Tide  Foundation,  the  Southern  Research  Institute,  UAB  Research 
Foundation, and Triton Health Systems, L.L.C. are blended component units of the University of Alabama, therefore, are included 
in all amounts reported for the University.  
 
In addition to the blended component units, there are other legally separate, tax exempt organizations that are discretely presented 
component units of the universities.  These organizations generally exist to raise funds to benefit a specific university.  Although 
the  university  may  not  control  the  timing  or  amount  of  receipts  from  these  foundations,  the  majority  of  resources  that  the 
foundations hold and invest are restricted to benefit the activities of the universities by the donors.  Because the resources are held 
for the benefit of the universities, the foundations are considered the discretely presented component units of the universities and 
are included in each of the universities’ financial statements.  For the University of Alabama, the University’s discretely presented 
component  units  are  The  National  Alumni  Association  of  The  University  of  Alabama,  The  Capstone  Foundation,  The  1831 
Foundation,  The  University  of Alabama  Law  School  Foundation,  and The  University  of  Alabama  Huntsville  Foundation.   For 
Alabama  State  University,  the  Alabama  State  University  Trust  for  Educational  Excellence  is  a  component  unit.    For  Auburn 
University,  the  University’s  component  units  are  The  Auburn  University  Foundation,  The  Tigers  Unlimited  Foundation,  and

a memorial park centered near the historic battleship. 
 
The fourteen-member board of directors of the Housing Finance Authority is appointed by various state officials.  The Authority 
sells bonds and uses the proceeds to make it possible for lenders to make low interest rate mortgages available to low income home 
buyers.  The primary government does not affect the Authority's budget, but the legislature has historically limited the Authority's 
ability to issue bonds.  Audited financial statements may be obtained from the Authority, P.O. Box 230909, 2000 Interstate Park 
Drive, Suite 408, Montgomery, AL 36123-0909.

The Alabama International Airport Authority was created to develop an international airport in the State.  The State controls the 
appointment of only five of the ten members.  All funding for the Authority was historically through the General Fund, so the 
Authority  is  subject  to  full  budgetary  control.    The  Authority  has  received  no  funding  for  a  number  of  years  so  is  currently 
inactive.  
 
The  Historical  Commission  is  responsible  for  the  preservation  of  historic  sites,  buildings,  and  objects.    The  twenty-member 
Commission is not controlled by the State, but the Commission's budget is subject to State control. 
 
The  Choctawhatchee  Pea  and  Yellow  Rivers  Watershed  Management  Authority  develops  and  executes  plans  for  water 
conservation  and  usage,  flood  control  and  prevention,  water  pollution  control,  wildlife  habitat  protection,  and  erosion  control 
within the boundaries of the Authority.  The directors of the Authority are elected by local residents, but the Authority is subject to 
State budgetary control. 
 
The Agricultural Museum Board exists to preserve and exhibit agricultural artifacts.  The Board is not controlled by the State, but 
it is subject to State budgetary control. 
 
The Music Hall of Fame operates a public exhibit displaying music memorabilia in honor of Alabamians who have made a lasting 
contribution to music.  The Hall has both an independent board and is fiscally independent of the State.  The Hall is included in 
these financial statements because it would be misleading to exclude.  The State has some limited budgetary influence and the 
State funded the construction of the Hall's facilities with a general obligation bond issue. 
 
The Historic Blakeley Authority preserves the historic site of the town of Blakeley and operates a park on the site.  The Authority 
has both an independent board and is fiscally independent of the State.  The Authority is included in the reporting entity because 
the State has some limited budgetary influence and the State provides the majority of the Authority's funding. 
 
The Alabama Incentives Financing Authority was created to fulfill the State's financial commitments made to industries locating 
and expanding in the State under the terms of legislation granting certain financial incentives.  The Authority is made up of three 
state officials and is authorized to issue bonds to fulfill the State's financial commitments. 
 
The  Revolving  Loan  Fund  Authority  was  created  to  make  grants  to  twelve  regional  planning  commissions  for  the  purpose  of 
financing local economic development projects.  Four of the six members of the Authority are state officials. 
 
The  Alabama  Twenty-first  Century  Authority  was  created  to  promote  economic  development  and  industrial  recruitment.    The 
Authority can issue revenue bonds and pledge part of the proceeds of the settlement of the tobacco industry litigation to finance the 
bonds.  The Authority is made up of three state officials. 
 
The Agricultural Development Authority promotes development of agriculture in the State by making low interest loans available 
to persons engaged in agricultural operations.  The seven-member board is made up of three state officials and four other persons 
appointed by the State. 
 
The Public Historical Sites and Parks Improvement Corporation renovates, improves, maintains, and constructs State owned public 
historical sites and parks not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources as well as non-State 
owned public historical sites and parks.  The six members of the Corporation are state officials. 
 
The  Red  Mountain  Greenway  and  Recreational  Area  Commission  is  responsible  for  preserving,  restoring,  and  promoting  as  a 
greenway, recreational area, or historic site certain land in Birmingham which played an important role in the steel industry of the 
State.    The fifteen member Commission is not controlled by the State, but the Commission is fiscally dependent on the State.   

4. Fiduciary Component Units 
Fiduciary  component  units  are  required  by  GAAP  to  be  reported  as  fiduciary  funds  of  the  primary  government  rather  than  as 
discretely presented component units.  In accordance with GAAP, fiduciary funds and component units that are fiduciary in nature 
are excluded from the government-wide financial statements. 
 
The Employees’ Retirement System (ERS), a discretely presented component unit, operates several pension (and other employee 
benefit) trust funds for the benefit of state and local governmental employees.  The ERS is governed by a thirteen-member board 
of control, seven of whom are either primary government officials or appointees of the Governor.

employees of public education institutions throughout the State.  It is governed by a fourteen-member board, ten of whom are 
elected from among the member employees.  The administrative budget of TRS is subject to approval by the State.   Audited

5. Excluded Organizations 
Other entities have been examined but failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the State's reporting entity.  City and county 
boards of education are legally separate organizations whose boards are not controlled by the State.  They are fiscally dependent 
on both the State and local government.  It is more appropriate that they be included in a local government's reporting entity. 
 
The  Elk  River  Development  Agency,  Bear  Creek  Development  Authority,  and  Cahaba  Trace  Commission  are  legally  separate 
organizations  whose  boards  are  not  controlled  by  the  State  nor  are  they  fiscally  dependent  on  the  State.    All  three  of  these 
organizations are excluded.  The many local soil and water conservation districts are legally separate organizations which have 
independent boards and are fiscally independent.  In keeping with their independence, they are excluded from this report. 

6. Sources of Information 
The majority of state organizations, whether primary government or component unit, conduct their financial operations from the 
State  Treasury  through  the  State's  central  accounting  system  under  the  supervision  and  review  of  the  State  Comptroller,  State 
Treasurer, and State Auditor.  The source of information on these agencies is the State's central accounting system.  For these 
agencies, the recording of cash, warrants payable, encumbrances, salaries payable, compensated absences, most investments, most 
short-term  payables,  most  revenues,  and  most  expenditures/expenses  are  controlled  by  the  State  Comptroller  and/or  the  State 
Treasurer and are therefore subject to extensive scrutiny.  Accruals of revenues, a few accruals of expenditures/expenses, and all 
other accounts, such as depreciation, capital assets, inventories, and capital leases, generally are based on data provided by the 
individual agencies.  The data provided by the agencies are reviewed and recorded once a year and are believed to be materially 
correct even though they are not generally subject to extensive scrutiny by the State Comptroller, State Treasurer, or State Auditor.   
 
There are some organizations and funds which meet the criteria for inclusion as part of the reporting entity even though they have 
the  authority  to  conduct  their  financial  operations  through  bank  accounts  and  accounting  systems  outside  the  State  Treasury, 
independent of the direct daily control of the State Comptroller, State Treasurer, and State Auditor.  These non-Treasury agencies 
are included in the financial statements based on information provided to the State Comptroller once a year by the agency or the 
agency's auditors.  Whenever possible, the non-Treasury agencies are reported as they appeared in the information submitted to the 
State Comptroller.  However, corrections or modifications have been made whenever required to comply with generally accepted 
accounting principles or wherever necessary to ensure consistent statewide report presentation.

B. Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 

1. Government-Wide Financial Statements 
Government-wide financial statements include two basic financial statements:  the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of 
Activities.    The  two  statements  report  the  State’s  governmental  activities  separately  from  its  business-type  activities.  
Governmental  activities  generally  are  financed  through  taxes,  intergovernmental  revenues,  and  other  nonexchange  revenues.  
Business-type activities are financed in whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods or services.  Fiduciary funds 
and fiduciary-type component units are excluded from the government-wide financial statements.  
 
The Statement of Net Assets presents the reporting entity’s non-fiduciary assets and liabilities, with the difference reported as net 
assets.  Net Assets are reported in three categories: 
 
Invested  in  Capital  Assets,  Net  of  Related  Debt  consists  of  capital  assets,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation  and  reduced  by 
outstanding balances for bonds, notes, and other debt that are attributed to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those 
assets. 
 
Restricted  Net  Assets  result  when  constraints  placed  on  net  asset  use  are  either  externally  imposed  by  creditors,  grantors, 
contributors, and the like, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 
 
Unrestricted Net Assets consist of net assets that do not meet the definition of the two preceding categories.  Unrestricted net assets 
often are designated, to indicate that management does not consider them available for general operations. 
 
The  Statement  of  Activities  demonstrates  the  degree  to  which  the  direct  expenses  of  a  given  function  or  segment  is  offset  by 
program revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable within a specific function.  Program revenues include 1) 
charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given 
function  and  2)  grants  and  contributions  that  are  restricted  to  meeting  the  operational  or  capital  requirements  of  a  particular 
function.  Taxes and other items not meeting the definition of program revenues are reported as general revenue. 

 
64 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Fund Financial Statements 
Separate fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the 
latter are excluded from the government-wide statements.  Major individual governmental funds and major individual proprietary 
funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements, with nonmajor funds being combined into a single column. 

C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation  

1. Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting 
These  financial  statements  are  reported  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  unless  otherwise 
noted on the face of the statement or in the Notes to the Financial Statements.  GAAP basis reporting differs considerably in some 
ways from the budgetary and cash basis accounting under which the State budgets and operates. 

a. Accrual Basis 
Under  GAAP,  the  government-wide  statements  are  reported  using  the  economic  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  accrual 
basis  of  accounting,  as  are  the  proprietary  and  fiduciary  fund  financial  statements.  Agency  funds,  however,  do  not  have  a 
measurement focus.  Revenues are recognized and recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred for 
exchange  and  exchange-like  transactions,  regardless  of  the  timing  of  cash  flows.    For  nonexchange  transactions,  revenues  and 
expenditures and related assets and liabilities are recognized as required by GASB Statement No. 33.  For derived nonexchange 
transactions,  receivables  and  revenues  are recognized  when  the  underlying  exchange has  occurred.    For  imposed  nonexchange 
transactions, receivables are recognized when an enforceable legal claim has arisen.  Revenues are recognized when resources are 
required to be used or the first period that use is permitted. 
 
Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied.  For government mandated nonexchange revenues 
such as grants, GAAP require the recognition of assets, revenues, liabilities, and expenditures when all eligibility requirements 
have  been  met  and  (for  revenues)  resources  are  available.    Agency  funds,  fiduciary  in  nature,  do  not  recognize  revenues  and 
expenditures. 
 
The State has elected to exercise paragraph 6 of GASB Statement No. 20, "Accounting and Financial Reporting for Proprietary 
Funds and Other Governmental Entities That Use Proprietary Fund Accounting."  Statement No. 20, paragraph 6, requires that all 
proprietary activities should apply all applicable GASB pronouncements as well as any Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) Statements and Interpretations, Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins (ARBs) 
of the Committee on Accounting Procedure (CAP) issued on or before November 30, 1989, unless such FASB, APB, and CAP 
pronouncements  conflict  with  or  contradict  GASB  pronouncements.    FASB  pronouncements  issued  after  November  30,  1989, 
even  if  they  modify  an  applicable  FASB,  APB,  or  CAP  pronouncement,  are  not  applicable  unless  adopted  by  a  GASB 
pronouncement. 

b. Modified Accrual Basis 
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified 
accrual basis of  accounting.   Under  this  focus, only  current  assets  and  current  liabilities  generally  are  included  on  the balance 
sheet.  Revenues are recognized as they become susceptible to accrual; generally when they are both measurable and available.  
Revenues  are  considered  to  be  available  when  they  are  collected  within  the  current  period  or  soon  enough  thereafter  to  pay 
liabilities of the current period.  For this purpose, the State generally considers tax revenues and court settlements to be available if 
they are collected within sixty days of the end of the fiscal period.  Revenues that the State earns by incurring obligations are 
recognized in the period when all applicable eligibility requirements have been met and the resources are available.  The State 
considers revenues earned by incurring obligations to be available if they are collected within sixty days of the end of the fiscal 
period.  Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is  incurred, as under accrual accounting.  However, expenditures 
related to debt service, compensated absences, and claims and judgments are recorded only when payment is due and payable. 
 
Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, recognition criteria are different for exchange and nonexchange transactions.  For 
exchange and exchange-like transactions, revenues and related current assets are recognized when measurable and available to 
finance operations during the year or if available to liquidate liabilities existing at the end of the year.  Therefore, in governmental 
fund  financial  statements,  revenues  and  the  resulting  assets  are  accrued  at  year-end  only  if  the  revenues  are  earned  and  the 
receivables  are  expected  to  be  collected  in  time  to  pay  for  liabilities  in  existence  at  the  end  of  the  period.    Expenditures  are 
recognized  when  the  related fund  liability  is  incurred,  except  for  items  that  are  not  expected  to be  liquidated  with  expendable 
available  resources,  such  as  the  long-term  portion  of  compensated  absences  payable  and  capital  lease  obligations.    Therefore, 
expenditures  and  the  related  liabilities  are  accrued  at  year-end only  when  they  are  normally  payable  from  current  expendable

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

funds.  In order to determine which revenues should be accrued, an arbitrary time limit is established.  Revenues are recognized 
when measurable and available.  The State uses sixty days after fiscal year end as the time limit for the accrual of revenues.  For 
nonexchange  transactions,  revenues  and  expenditures  and  related  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  as  required  by  GASB 
Statement No. 33.  For income taxes, general sales taxes, utility taxes, insurance premium taxes, general use taxes, gasoline taxes, 
motor fuels tax, electric public utility tax, and other derived nonexchange transactions, receivables and revenues are recognized 
when the underlying exchange has occurred and the resources are available.  For property taxes, business privilege tax, and other 
imposed  nonexchange  transactions,  receivables  are  recognized  when  an  enforceable  legal  claim  has  arisen.    Revenues  are 
recognized when resources are required to be used or the first period that use is permitted and the resources are available.  For 
property taxes, revenues are recognized if received within sixty days; otherwise, deferred revenue is recognized.  For federal grants 
and  other  government  mandated  nonexchange  revenues,  assets,  revenues,  liabilities,  and  expenditures  are  recognized  when  all 
eligibility  requirements  have  been  met  and  (for  revenues)  resources  are  available.    For  reimbursement-type  federal  grants, 
eligibility requirements are met when recipients incur allowable costs, not when those costs are submitted for reimbursement. 
 
Material  accruals  are  for  income  taxes,  general  sales  taxes,  utility  taxes,  insurance  premium  taxes,  general  use  taxes,  gasoline 
taxes, motor fuels tax, electric public utilities tax, property taxes, business privilege tax, hospital assessment fees, nursing facility 
tax, pharmaceutical services tax, federal grants, oil and gas royalties, investment sales receivables, and interest.  Also, a one time 
receivable for Medicaid reimbursements from the Alabama Hospital Association is accrued. 

2. Financial Statement Presentation 

a. Major Funds 
The State reports six major governmental funds. The General Fund is the State’s primary operating fund.  It accounts for all 
financial  resources  except  those  required  to  be  accounted  for  in  another  fund.    The  Education  Trust  Fund  accounts  for  the 
revenues collected for the support, maintenance, and development of public education in Alabama. The Alabama Trust Fund 
consists of income from the sale or lease of rights for offshore exploration and drilling for oil and gas off the Alabama coast.  
Investment  income  is  used  to  support  the  General  Fund,  Forever  Wild  Land  Trust,  and  a  variety  of  capital  projects  and  debt 
service.  Medicaid  accounts  for  the  portion  of  the  Medicaid  program  that  is  funded  by  Federal  revenues  and  other  non-State 
revenue sources. The Public Road and Bridge Fund accounts for highway construction, maintenance, and operations. The Public 
Welfare Trust Fund accounts for the administration of a broad range of social and protective services programs that provide 
financial assistance to individuals. 
 
The State reports four major enterprise funds.  The Unemployment Compensation Trust accounts for the activities of the federal 
unemployment insurance program including employer contributions, Federal Unemployment Trust advances, and benefit claims to 
the  unemployed.    The  State  Port  Authority  was  created  to  engage  in  promoting,  developing,  constructing,  maintaining,  and 
operating harbors, seaports, and river ports within the State of Alabama.  The Alabama College System accounts for the revenues 
and expenses of the State’s Community and Technical Colleges, Athens State University, the Alabama Industrial Development and 
Training Institute, the Alabama Technology Network, the Alabama Fire College, and Marion Military Institute.  The Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Board was created to control alcoholic beverages through distribution, licensing, and enforcement.   

b. Nonmajor Funds 
The State reports a number of nonmajor governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds.   
 
Governmental Fund Types: 
Special Revenue Funds include operating fund activities financed by specific revenue sources that are legally restricted for specific 
purposes.  Examples include public health, education, and economic and community affairs.   
 
Debt Service Funds account for the accumulation of resources for, and the payment of, governmental long-term debt principal and 
interest.   
 
Capital Projects Funds account for the acquisition, construction, and improvement of major general governmental capital assets 
financed principally by bond proceeds.   
 
Permanent Funds report resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for 
purposes that benefit the government or its citizenry. 
 
Proprietary Fund Types: 
Enterprise Funds report the activities for which fees are charged to external users for goods or services such as health insurance. 

 
66 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Internal Service Funds provide goods or services primarily to other agencies or funds of the State, rather than to the general public.  
Examples  include  information  technology,  telecommunications,  office  building  rentals,  and  the  State  Motor  Pool.    In  the 
government-wide statements, internal service funds are included with governmental activities.  Eliminations have been made to 
minimize the double counting of internal activity, including internal service fund type activity on the government-wide financial 
statements. 
 
Fiduciary Fund Types: 
Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Funds account for resources that are required to be held in trust for the members and 
beneficiaries  of  the  State’s  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  deferred  compensation  plan,  individual  retirement  accounts,  post-
employment health care plans, and flexible employees’ benefit plans.  The defined benefit pension plans include plans for state 
employees, state police, some city and county employees, teachers, judges, peace officers, state dock employees, and circuit clerks 
of the courts. 
 
Private  Purpose  Trust  Funds  account  for  resources  of  all  other  trust  arrangements  in  which  principal  and  income  benefit 
individuals, private organizations, or other governments.  The State’s largest private purpose funds are education related for either 
college  tuition  benefits  or  local  public  schools.    There  are  five  endowment  funds  established  by  private  citizens  that  the  State 
manages as trustee for local school systems and reports as Local Education Endowments.  The Foundation for Local Schools was 
established so that the Retirement Systems of Alabama can use its investing expertise to get maximum return on investments for 
numerous small local school foundations and trusts.   
 
Agency Funds report assets and liabilities for deposits and investments entrusted to the State as an agent for others.  The State has 
agency funds that account for some taxes collected, payroll withholdings, child support payments, cash bonds, and other purposes. 

D. Fiscal Year 
The State fiscal year ends on September 30.  One component unit, the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission, has the power 
to set its own fiscal year (Code of Alabama 1975, Section 41-10-307, as amended).  The Commission has set its fiscal year to end 
on the last Sunday in September in order to coordinate its accounting period with the weekly cycle of campers.  The Commission's 
fiscal year for 2010 ended on September 26.  The difference in fiscal years had no material effect on the financial statements. 

E. Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets and Fund Balances 

1. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, as reported on the financial statements (the government-wide and the fund financial statements), are 
under the control of the State Treasurer or other administrative bodies as determined by law.  The cash in all funds operating from 
the State Treasury is pooled as treasury cash and invested by the State Treasurer.  The State Treasurer has statutory authority to 
invest treasury cash in demand accounts or time deposit-open accounts with any qualified public depository.  The State Treasurer 
can also invest up to twenty percent of treasury cash in securities and obligations of the U.S. Treasury or federal agencies for a 
period of time that may exceed one year.  All of the cash and investments in the State Treasury cash management pool are reported 
as cash and cash equivalents because the pool is used essentially as a demand deposit account.   Commercial paper is reported as 
an investment regardless of the original maturity date.  For funds operating outside the State Treasury, cash and cash equivalents 
generally include demand deposit accounts, petty cash accounts, and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date of 
three months or less when purchased. 

2. Receivables 
In the government-wide and governmental fund financial statements, the largest receivables are amounts accrued for income taxes, 
general sales taxes, utility taxes, insurance premium taxes, general use taxes, and property taxes as required by GASB Statement 
No. 33.   
 
The second largest receivables are amounts due from other governments, consisting almost entirely of grants and reimbursements 
due from the federal government where collectability is reasonably assured.  Accordingly, no allowance for uncollectible accounts 
has been established.  Amounts due from local governments are not a significant portion of amounts due from other governments. 
 

 

67 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
The property tax calendar for the State is simple.  The levy date, the assessment date, and the lien date are all the same date – 
October 1.  On October 1, the assessed value of all property is multiplied by the applicable rates to levy the property tax.  On that 
date, the State has a lien (a legal claim) against the property.  The property tax is not due until October 1 the following year.  The 
property tax is paid in arrears between October 1 and December 31.  After December 31, it is delinquent. 
 
The most significant Accounts Receivable is recorded in Medicaid.  The Medicaid receivable was for a one-time reimbursement 
from the Alabama Hospital Association for the Prepaid Hospital Plan which will be replaced by a new program in fiscal year 2011.  
The second most significant Accounts Receivable is recorded in the Alabama Trust Fund for oil and gas royalties earned on natural 
gas produced in Alabama’s offshore waters. The primary government has minimal amounts of Notes and Loans Receivable, as 
such  agreements  would  constitute  an  illegal  extension  of  credit  by  the  State  for  any  fund  operating  from  the  State  Treasury.  
Interest and Dividends Receivable includes amounts earned on investments, notes, mortgages, and loans receivable. Investment 
Sales Receivable consists of amounts receivable for investments sold but the transaction was not settled before year-end. 
 
For  component  units,  about  half  of  Mortgages,  Notes,  and  Loans  Receivable  consist  of  loans  made  by  the  Alabama  Housing 
Finance Authority.  The mortgage loans of the Authority are carried at their unpaid principal balances less an allowance for loan 
losses.  Also included in this category are student loans owed to various Universities and the Alabama Higher Education Loan 
Corporation.  The loans are reported net of an allowance for uncollectible loans.   
 
Due  From  Other  Governments  as  reported  for  the  component  units  consists  almost  entirely  of  amounts  owed  by  local 
governments.  Most of the amount consists of loans made by the Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority and the Drinking 
Water Finance Authority.  Accounts Receivable as reported for the component units are comprised primarily of amounts owed to 
colleges. 

3. Interfund Activity and Balances 
Activity  between  funds  that are  representative  of  lending/borrowing  arrangements  outstanding  at  the end of  the fiscal  year  are 
reported as either Due To Other Funds or Due From Other Funds.  Any residual balances outstanding between the governmental 
activities and business-type activities are reported in the government-wide financial statements as Internal Balances. Receivables 
and payables involving fiduciary funds are presented as accounts payable or receivable on the government-wide Statement of Net 
Assets. 
 
Eliminations have been made to minimize the double-counting of internal activity, including internal service fund type activity on 
the government-wide financial statements.  However, interfund services, provided and used between different functions, have not 
been eliminated in order to avoid distorting the direct costs and program revenues of the applicable functions.  Operating transfers 
between governmental and business-type activities are reported at the net amount on the government-wide financial statements. 
 
In the fund financial statements, transactions for services rendered by one fund to another are treated as revenues of the recipient 
fund and expenditures/expenses of the disbursing fund.  Reimbursements of expenditures/expenses made by one fund for another 
are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the reimbursing fund and as a reduction of expenditures/expenses in the reimbursed fund.  
Transfers  represent  flows  of  assets  between  funds  of  the  primary  government  without  equivalent  flows of  assets  in  return  and 
without a requirement for payment. 

4. Inventories 
Inventories of supplies in governmental fund financial statements are reported at cost using the purchases method.  An inventory 
asset account is reported on the balance sheet with an offset to Reserved for Inventory.  Inventories of materials and supplies on 
proprietary  fund  financial  statements  are  determined  by  both  physical  counts  and  through  perpetual  inventory  systems  and  are 
valued at the lower of cost or market.  Valuation methods used on the proprietary and governmental fund financial statements 
include first-in first-out, average cost, weighted average, and retail inventory method.  

5. Investments 
Investments as reported on the Statement of Net Assets include long-term investments.  As required by GASB Statement No. 31, 
“Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for External Investment Pools”, most investments are recorded 
at fair value.  Securities traded on national or international exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange 
rates.  Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.  Mortgage-backed securities are reported based 
on future principal and interest payments discounted at the current interest rate for similar instruments.  The fair value of real estate 
investments is based on independent appraisals.  No investments are recorded at amortized cost.

6. Restricted Assets 
Assets  required  to  be  held  and/or  used  as  specified  in  bond  covenants,  other  debt  agreements,  donor  specifications,  and  court 
settlements have been recorded as "Restricted Assets."  These assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury 
obligations and certificates of deposit.

7. Capital Assets 
Capital assets, which include buildings, land, equipment, intangibles, and infrastructure (e.g., roads and bridges), are reported in 
the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements.  Most capital assets 
are defined by the State as assets with an initial cost of at least $5,000 and have initial useful lives extending beyond a single 
reporting period.  Software and other intangibles must have an initial cost of at least $100,000.  Capitalized assets are recorded at 
historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed.  Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market 
value at the date of donation.  The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially 
extend  assets  lives  are  not  capitalized.    Major  outlays  for  capital  assets  and  improvements  are  capitalized  as  projects  are 
constructed.  Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: 
 
Assets 
 
 
Buildings 
 
Improvements Other than Buildings  
 
Equipment 
Software 
 
 
Land,  infrastructure,  construction  in  progress  and  historical  artifacts  are  not  depreciated.    The  State  has  elected  to  apply  the 
modified approach to accounting for infrastructure (e.g., roadways, bridges, and tunnels).  Under this approach, the infrastructure 
assets  are  not  depreciated  because  the  State  is  committed  to  maintaining  the  assets  at  a  minimum  condition  level  that  the 
Department of Transportation (ALDOT) has determined to be adequate to meet the needs of the citizens.  Costs for maintenance 
and preservation are expensed in the period incurred.  Additions and improvements are capitalized.  The ALDOT maintains an 
inventory of all infrastructure assets and performs regular condition assessments of those assets to establish that they are in fact 
being maintained at or above the condition level established.  ALDOT also makes an annual estimate of the cost necessary to 
maintain  and  preserve  those  infrastructure  assets  at  the  target  condition  level.    The  cost  of  infrastructure  reported  includes 
historical costs from 1980 to the present as required by GASB Statement No. 34 as well as historical costs preceding 1980.     
 
Extensive  project  documentation  is  required  to  meet  various  Federal  and  State  guidelines  concerning  the  construction  of 
infrastructure.  The completeness of this documentation affects the timing of project capitalization.  The State capitalizes road and 
bridge infrastructure annually when all costs for a project are incurred and all project documentation is satisfactorily completed, 
filed and accepted with the appropriate entities.  Projects that meet the cost and documentation criteria are closed and appropriate 
entries  are  made  to  adjust  the  Infrastructure  Construction  in  Progress  and  Infrastructure  asset  accounts  annually.    Due  to  the 
documentation  requirements,  there  can  be  substantial  time  lags  between  the  date  a  project  is  put  into  service  on  the  State’s 
roadway network and the date the project is capitalized.  A significant portion of Infrastructure Construction in Progress consists of 
projects that have been put into service and maintenance costs could have been incurred. 

 

8. Compensated Absences 
Employees in permanent positions accrue annual leave at a rate of four hours and 20 minutes to nine hours and 45 minutes semi-
monthly, depending upon their length of service.  Upon separation from service, an eligible employee is paid for the actual number 
of annual leave days he has earned, up to a maximum of sixty days, with the amount being computed on the basis of his daily pay 
rate at time of separation multiplied by the number of days leave due. 
 
Sick leave is accrued at a rate of four hours and 20 minutes semi-monthly.  Employees may accumulate up to a maximum of 150 
days sick leave.  Employees may be compensated for one-half of the maximum accrued sick leave only upon retirement from state 
service.  The employee must have twenty-five years of service or have attained the age of 60 and have ten years of service to be 
eligible  to retire.   State  Troopers  must  have  twenty-five years  of service  or have  attained  the  age  of  52  and have  ten  years of 
service to be eligible to retire.  If a state employee in the classified service dies while in active service to the State, the estate of the 
deceased employee receives a payment of fifty percent of the accrued and unused sick leave, not to exceed 600 hours, which the 
employee was credited with at the time of his or her death. 
 
The monetary value of accumulated annual and sick leave payable upon termination or retirement is included in the government-
wide statement of net assets, proprietary fund financial statements, and fiduciary fund financial statements.  In the governmental 
fund financial statements, amounts reported are for unused, matured leave amounts payable to employees whose employment was

terminated by September 30.  These amounts are paid to the employees during the first month after the end of the fiscal year so 
those  actual  payments  were  used  to  compute  the  amount  payable.    Amounts  not  payable  from  expendable  available  resources 
(long-term liabilities) are reported in the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.   
 
The liability for compensated absences was computed using salary rates effective at fiscal year end including the employer's share 
of social security and Medicare taxes payable and represents annual and sick leave earned up to the allowable ceilings.  The sick 
leave  is  calculated  separately  for  vested  and  non-vested  employees.    Sick  leave  is  subjected  to  an  actuarially  determined 
probability multiplier that the employee will remain to retire and collect sick leave.  The probability multipliers are as follows: 
 

Vested 
  0.84 
  0.77 

           Non-vested 
 
 

   0.46 
   0.34 

Public Education Employees 
State Employees   
  
 

9. Long-Term Obligations 
Long-term  debt  is  recognized  as  a  liability  in  governmental  fund  financial  statements  when due, or when resources  have been 
accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year.  For other long-term obligations, only that portion 
expected to be financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a liability  in governmental fund financial 
statements.    The  remaining  portion  of  such  obligations  is  reported  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.    Long-term 
liabilities  expected  to  be  financed  from  proprietary  fund  operations  are  accounted  for  in  those  funds  in  the  proprietary  fund 
financial statements. 

10. Net Assets and Fund Balances  
As discussed previously, net assets on the government-wide financial statements and the proprietary fund financial statements are 
reported in three categories: (1) invested in capital assets, net of related debt; (2) restricted net assets; and (3) unrestricted net 
assets.  Reservations of fund balance on the governmental fund financial statements indicate that a portion of the fund balance is 
not available for appropriation and expenditure or is legally segregated for a specific future use.  Fund balance designations are 
established to indicate tentative plans for financial resource utilization in a future period.  Such designations reflect managerial 
plans or intent as distinguished from legally required reserves. 

F. Proprietary Fund Operating Revenues and Expenses 
Proprietary funds report operating revenues and expenses separately from non-operating items.  Operating items generally result 
from producing and delivering goods and services that are a normal part of the primary business of the fund.  Operating expenses 
for enterprise funds and internal service funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on 
capital assets.  Revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues and expenses. 

G. New Accounting Pronouncements 
During the current fiscal year, the State implemented the following new accounting pronouncements: 

  GASB Statement No. 51:  Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets 
  GASB Statement No. 53:  Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments 
  GASB Statement No. 58:  Accounting and Financial Reporting for Chapter 9 Bankruptcies

NOTE 2 - FUND BALANCES/NET ASSETS 

A. Restricted Net Assets 
The Government-wide Statement of Net Assets reports $5 billion of restricted net assets for the primary government, of which 
$296 million is restricted by enabling legislation. 

B. Restatements 
Fund Balances and Net Assets as of October 1, 2009 have been restated for certain accounting changes necessary to conform to 
GAAP.  No major primary government governmental funds were restated, nor were any fiduciary funds restated.  However, fund 
balance  for  The  Public  Health  Care  Authority,  a  Nonmajor  Debt  Service  Fund,  was  restated  by  $317,000  from  $307,000  to 
$624,000 for a receivable not reported in 2009.  Internal Service Funds were restated by $2,307,000, primarily because receivables 
and capital assets were understated.   
 
Net assets for the Port Authority were restated by $13,912,000 to book a derivative in conjunction with the implementation of 
GASB Statement 53.  Net assets for the Alabama College System were restated by $3,417,000, the largest portion of which was 
$2,405,000 increase in capital assets.  Net Assets for nonmajor enterprise funds decreased $1,352,000 while internal service funds 
increased by the same amount because a fund was reclassified when it ceased to do business with external users.  
 
On  the  government-wide  financial  statements,  beginning  net  assets  for  governmental  activities  were  restated  down  from 
$22,083,318 to $22,077,358, a decrease of $5,960,000.  Included in this restatement was ($13,379,000) in governmental long-term 
debt restatements for capital leases which were not reported in the previous year.  Governmental capital assets were restated in 
total by $5,932,000, of which $777,000 was associated with the implementation of GASB Statement 51.  
 
The  Alabama  Public  School  and  College  Authority,  a  major  component  unit,  was  restated  by  $75,560,000  from  a  deficit  of 
1,735,985,000 to a deficit of 1,811,545,000 as part of the implementation of GASB Statement 53 on accounting for derivatives.  
 
The  University  of  Alabama,  a  major  component  unit,  was  restated  down  by  $64,097,000  because  the  University  of  Alabama 
Birmingham  Hospital  incorporated  in  2010  the  operations  of  an  entity  previously  considered  to  be  an  affiliated  organization.  
Nonmajor Component Units were restated up $781,000.  
 
The University of South Alabama, a major component unit, was restated down by $8,015,000 resulting from the implementation of 
GASB Statement 53 on accounting for derivatives. 

C. Fund Balance/Net Assets Deficits 

1. Primary Government 
 
The Education Trust Fund, a major governmental fund, had a deficit in unreserved, undesignated fund balance of $247,559,000, 
and a total deficit in fund balance of $244,526,000.  Tax shortfalls caused the budget of the fund to undergo 9.5 percent proration 
in 2010.  The fund still owes the Alabama Trust Fund $437.4 million that was borrowed from the Rainy Day Trust Account in 
fiscal year 2009 under the provisions of Amendment 803 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.   
 
The Unemployment Compensation Trust, a major proprietary fund, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $152,806,000.  The 
deficit is the result of a $283,671,000 advance from the Federal Government which is included in “Due to Other Governments.” 
 
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, a major proprietary fund, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $17,510,000, with a 
total net asset deficit of $13,459,000.  The deficits are largely due to the accrual of liabilities for compensated absences, salaries 
payable, other post-employment benefits, and profits currently due to other funds.  The Board, by law, operates on a cash basis and 
is required to distribute 100 percent of its profits.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
The Building Renovation Finance Authority, an internal service fund, had a deficit balance of $5,167,000 in net assets invested in 
capital  assets,  net  of  related  debt.  The  fund’s  major  assets  are  buildings,  which  have  depreciated  values  that  are  less  than  the 
principal remaining on the long-term debt associated with them. The fund had overall positive net assets of $8,173,000. 
 
The Flexible Employees’ Benefits Board, an Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund, had deficit net assets of $1,510,000 because of 
liabilities  to  employees  for  health  care  and  dependent  care  reimbursements.    The  fund  does  not  break  even  until  the  end  of 
December because it operates on a calendar year basis. 

2. Component Units 
 
The  Public  School  and  College  Authority,  a  major  component  unit,  had  a  deficit  in  unrestricted  net  assets  of  $1,986,760,000 
causing  a  deficit  in  total  net  assets of  $1,975,972,000.    The Authority  issues  bonds  to  raise  money  for  grants  which  are  made 
primarily to local school systems for the construction and improvement of educational buildings owned by those systems.  The 
bonds will be repaid with future tax revenues pledged by the primary government. 
 
Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University, a nonmajor component unit, has a deficit of $7,754,000 in unrestricted net assets, 
but overall net assets are a positive $79,611,000.   
 
The Space Science Exhibit Commission, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $6,994,000 and 
positive overall net assets of $35,417,000.  Nearly all of the Commission’s assets are either restricted or capital assets.    
 
The Incentives Finance Authority, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $101,529,000 with an 
overall deficit in total net assets of $92,811,000.  The Authority issues bonds to raise money to fund commitments for economic 
development grants to industries relocating to Alabama and therefore the Authority accumulates few assets.  The resources to pay 
the debt will come from future tax revenues pledged by the primary government. 
 
The Historic Ironworks Commission, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets of $21,000, with positive 
total net assets of $3,042,000. 
 
The Revolving Loan Fund Authority, a nonmajor component unit, had a deficit in unrestricted net assets and in total net assets of 
$8,387,000.  The Authority issues bonds for making grants to Regional Planning and Development Commissions to be utilized as 
revolving  loans  by  the  grantees.    The  resources  to  repay  the  debt  will  come  from  future  tax  revenues  pledged  by  the  primary 
government. 

NOTE 3 - ASSETS  

A. Cash Deposits 
The State Treasurer has statutory authority to deposit treasury cash in demand accounts or time deposit - open accounts with any 
qualified public depository.  The State Treasurer may also invest up to twenty percent of treasury cash in securities and obligations 
of the U.S. Treasury or federal agencies for a period of time that may exceed one year.  Funds may also be invested in obligations 
of the United States or its agencies under a repurchase agreement for a shorter period of time than the maturity date of the security.  
 
Deposits of both the primary government and its component units are entirely insured by Federal depository insurance or protected 
under the Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement (SAFE) Program.  The Code of Alabama 1975, as amended, requires all State 
organizations,  including  component  units,  to  participate  in  the  SAFE  Program.    The  SAFE  Program  is  a  multiple  financial 
institution collateral pool.  The SAFE Program requires State treasury cash to be deposited in a financial institution designated by 
the State Treasurer as a qualified public depository.  Each qualified public depository is required to pledge collateral in accordance 
with the rules established by the SAFE Board of Directors.  In the event that a qualified public depository defaults or becomes 
insolvent and the pledged collateral is insufficient to satisfy the claims of public depositors, the Code of Alabama 1975, Section 
41-14A-9(3) authorizes the State Treasurer to make assessments against the other qualified public depositories in the pool so that 
there will be no loss of public funds.  Also, all other public funds not managed by the State Treasurer are required to be deposited 
in a qualified public depository or placed through a qualified public depository which arranges for the funds to be deposited in 
federally  insured  banks  or  savings  associations  so  that  the  funds  and  accrued  interest  earned  on  them  are  fully  insured  by  the 

 
72 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and, at the same time, the qualified public depository receives or is credited with deposits 
from other banks or savings associations in an amount equal to or greater than the amount it arranged to be deposited in other 
banks and savings associations. 

B. Investments 
Investments  are  made  in  accordance  with  the  statutes  creating  the  various  agencies  of  the  State  of  Alabama.    The  following

under  the  Authority's  mortgage  revenue  bond  programs  contain  further  restrictions  on  the  investment  of  non-expended  bond 
proceeds;  however,  each  trust  indenture  must  be  consistent  with  the  Authority's  authorizing  legislation  with  respect  to  the 
definition of eligible investments.  The Authority's program investments consist of Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) pass-through certificates, all of which are pledged as security for the 
mortgage revenue bonds.   
 
Other investments include temporary and debt service reserve funds established under the provisions of various trust indentures,

The investment policy for the State Treasurer was mentioned earlier. The investments allowed are U.S. government or agency 
securities, repurchase agreements backed by U.S government or U.S. government agency securities, or mutual funds investing in 
U.S government or U.S. government agency securities. The U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities are rated Aaa 
or AAA.  Bond mutual funds may or may not be rated.   
 
As mentioned earlier the investments of the Alabama Trust Fund are limited to those authorized for the Retirement Systems of 
Alabama.  Domestic  fixed-maturity  investments  may  consist  of  rated  or  non-rated  securities.  International  fixed-maturity 
investments may consist of securities with a rating of at least A by one of the principal rating agencies at the time of purchase or 
acquisition, except that up to 2% of the fair value of each System’s total portfolio may be invested in obligations of sovereign 
countries with a rating of BBB or BAA at the time of purchase.  The Systems may hedge against the possible adverse effects of 
currency  fluctuations  on  each  System’s  portfolio  of  international  fixed  income  obligations  when  it  is  considered  appropriate.  
Short-term investments may consist of commercial paper rated at least A-2 and/or P-2, repurchase agreements, short-term U.S. 
securities, and other money market investments.  

2. Interest Rate Risk 
Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  interest  rates  of  debt  investments  will  adversely  affect  the  fair  value  of  those 
investments. The Treasurer’s Office policy states that the maximum effective maturity of any purchase will be five years.  Market 
accepted  average  life  at  time  of  purchase  shall  be  used  in  lieu  of  final  maturity  for  the  purpose  of  maturity  acceptability  of 
mortgage-backed  securities.    Average  effective  duration  should  be  plus  or  minus  30%  of  the  index  duration.    The  portfolio  is 
benchmarked against the Barclays Capital 1 - 3 Year Government Index. 
 
The  fair  value  of  fixed-maturity  investments  fluctuate  in  response  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates.    Increases  in  prevailing 
interest rates generally translate into decreases in fair value of those instruments.  The fair value of interest sensitive instruments 
may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other 
general market conditions.  Certain fixed maturity investments have call provisions that could result in shorter maturity periods.  
However, the Retirement System of Alabama’s intent is to hold all fixed maturity investments until maturity, and as such, the 
System’s fixed maturity investments are classified in the table as if they will be held to maturity.   
 
The investment policy of the Alabama Trust Fund states that the portfolio’s average duration is not to exceed 1.5 times that of the 
benchmark index. 
 
As of September 30, 2010 the State had the following investments and maturities:

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
The University of Alabama discloses the interest rate risk for the System Pool using the effective duration method.  The prices of 
fixed income securities with a longer time to maturity, measured by effective duration, tend to be more sensitive to changes in 
interest rates and, therefore, more volatile than those with shorter durations.  Effective duration is the approximate change in price 
of a security resulting from a 100 basis point (1 percentage point) change in the level of interest rates.  It is not a measure of time.  
The University does not have a specific policy relative to interest rate risk.

3. Foreign Currency Risk 
Foreign  currency  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  exchange  rates  will  adversely  affect  the  fair  value  of  an  investment.  The 
investment policy of the Alabama Trust Fund states that the exposure to emerging market securities shall be limited to 20% of the 
market value of the international portfolio.  Not more than 5% of the total stock portfolio may be invested in the common stock of 
any one corporation at the time of purchase and no more than 7% in any one corporation at market.  Not more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any one company may be held by the portfolio. 
 
In  order  for  an  international  security  to  be  eligible  for  purchase  by  the  Retirement  Systems  of  Alabama  (RSA),  the  issuing 
company must be incorporated in a country whose debt securities are eligible for purchase as discussed earlier, and the fair value 
of the aggregate outstanding equity of the issuing company must be at least $100 million.

4. Custodial Credit Risk 
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that an entity will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral 
securities that are in the possession of an outside party if the counterparty fails. 
 
State Treasurer – The State Treasurer’s policy with respect to repurchase agreements requires that the underlying securities be held 
in the counterparty’s safekeeping department, in the name of the State. 
 
Alabama Trust Fund (ATF) – The ATF’s custodian, Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM), administers a portion of the program for 
the  ATF.    The  ATF’s  custodial  credit  risk  policy  authorizes  BNYM  to  hold  securities  in  registered  form  in  the  name  of  its 
nominee.  The policy requires BNYM to establish and maintain one or more securities accounts (book entry system) in which 
BNYM will hold the securities.  These accounts are in the name of the ATF.

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) – The RSA’s custodial credit risk policy requires the custodial agent to hold or direct its 
agents or subcustodians to hold, for the account of the RSA all securities and other non-cash property other than securities in the 
Federal Reserve book-entry system, in a clearing agency which acts as a securities depository, or in another book-entry system.  
The RSA’s safekeeping agent holds all investments of the RSA in the RSA’s name with the exception of securities purchased with 
securities lending collateral.

5. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributable to the magnitude of a government’s investments with a single issuer.  
The investment policy of the Alabama Trust Fund states that the investment portfolio shall be diversified by both asset class and 
within asset classes, by economic sector and industry.  For equity investments, the aggregate investment in equity securities of any 
one issuing corporation shall not exceed 1% of the outstanding capital of such corporation.  For fixed income investments, the 
portfolio is to be diversified so that no more than 15% is invested in one industry, and no more than 5% of the total fixed income 
portfolio may be invested in securities of any one corporation.  As of September 30, 2010, there were no investments that exceeded 
the 5% of the total fixed income portfolio limit in any one corporation. 
 
The investment policies of the Retirement Systems of Alabama limit the aggregate amount that can be invested in each class of 
investments.  Domestic fixed income, international fixed income, domestic equity, international equity, alternative investments, 
and  short-term  investments  are  limited  to  50%,  10%,  65%,  25%,  10%,  and  20%,  respectively,  of  each  System’s  aggregate 
portfolio.  Also, each System may not purchase or hold more than 5% of any class of the outstanding stock of a foreign company.  
The  range  for  real  estate  may  not  exceed  15%  of  the  book  value  of  each  System’s  portfolio.    As  of  September  30,  2010,  the 
Teachers’  Retirement  System  (TRS)  and  Employees’  Retirement  System  (ERS)  owned  debt  and  equity  securities  of  Raycom 
Media Corporation which represented approximately 6.15% and 6.86%, respectively, of the TRS and the ERS investments and 
Goldman Sachs which represented approximately 6.63% of the TRS investments and 6.06% of the ERS investments. 

D. Securities Lending  
The Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS), the Employees’ Retirement System (ERS), and the Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF) are 
authorized by the Boards of Control to participate in a securities lending program.  The Alabama Trust Fund (ATF) investment 
managers  are  authorized  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  to  engage  in  securities  lending  under  guidelines  established  by  the  ATF 
Investment Committee.  The Retirement Systems of Alabama’s (RSA) custodian, State Street Bank and Trust Company (State 
Street), administers the program for the TRS, ERS, JRF, a portion of the program for the ATF, and some other funds of the State.  
Certain securities are loaned to borrowers approved by the RSA.  Approved borrowers of securities provide acceptable collateral in 
the form of cash (U.S. and foreign currency), any other assets permissible under Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act of 1934, 
U.S. and non U.S. equities and such other collateral as the parties may agree to in writing from time to time.  All security loans are 
open  loans  and  can  be  terminated  on  demand  by  the  TRS,  ERS,  JRF,  or  borrower.    The  initial  collateral  received  shall  have 
(depending on the nature of the loaned securities and the collateral received), a value of 102% or 105% of the fair value of the 

 
82 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
loaned securities, or such other value, but not less than 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities, as may be applicable in the 
jurisdiction  in  which  such  loaned  securities  are  customarily  traded.    Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  applicable  securities  loan 
agreement, State Street shall, in accordance with State Street’s reasonable and customary practices, mark loaned securities and 
collateral to their fair value each business day based upon the fair value of the collateral and the loaned securities at the close of the 
business employing the most recently available pricing information and shall receive and deliver collateral in order to maintain the 
value of the collateral at no less than 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities.  The lender cannot pledge or sell collateral 
securities received unless the borrower defaults. 
 
Cash collateral for TRS, ERS, and JRF is invested in the State Street Quality D Short-term Investments Fund (QDF).   As of 
September 30, 2010, the average term of the loans secured by QDF was 8, 8, and 9 days, respectively for the TRS, ERS, and JRF.  
Cash  collateral  investments  in  the  QDF  are  matured  as  needed  to  fulfill  loan  obligations.    There  is  no  direct  matching  of  the 
maturities of the loans with the investments made with cash collateral. The following describes the QDF’s guidelines.  The QDF’s 
average effective duration is restricted to 90 days or less.  The maximum option-adjusted duration of any variable rate security 
investment of the QDF shall be 2.5 years or less.  All fixed rate instruments must have an option-adjusted duration not to exceed 
18 months.  At the time of purchase, all securities with maturities of 13 months or less must qualify as first tier securities and all 
securities with maturities in excess of 13 months will be rated A or better by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating 
organizations (NRSROs), or, if not rated, be of comparable quality.  The QDF may invest in other State Street managed investment 
vehicles provided they conform to QDF guidelines.  
 
Cash collateral administered by State Street for ATF is invested in the State Street Global Securities Lending Trust (SSGSLT).  As 
of  September  30,  2010,  the  average  term  of  the  loans  secured  by  SSGSLT  was  10  days.    Cash  collateral  investments  in  the 
SSGSLT are matured as needed to fulfill loan obligations.  There is no direct matching of the maturities of the loans with the 
investments  made  with  cash  collateral.    The  following  describes  the  SSGSLT’s  investment  policy  guidelines.    The  investment 
manager shall maintain  the  dollar-weighted  average  maturity  of  SSGSLT  in  a  manner  that  the  investment  manager  believes  is 
appropriate to the objective of maintaining a stable net asset value per share; provided that (i) in no event shall any security be 
acquired with a remaining maturity of greater than 397 calendar days and (ii) the dollar-weighted average maturity of SSGSLT 
shall in no event exceed 90 days.  SSGSLT will endeavor to maintain sufficient liquidity to support collateral return obligations 
under securities loan transactions.   
 
The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) administers a portion of the securities lending program for the ATF. Certain securities 
from ATF are loaned to borrowers approved by the ATF Board of Trustees.  Approved borrowers of securities provide acceptable 
cash collateral in the form of Federal funds or New York Clearing House funds as applicable for a particular loan.  All security 
loans are open loans and can be terminated on demand by the ATF, BNYM, or the borrower.  The initial collateral received shall 
have (i) in the case of loaned securities denominated in United States Dollars, cash collateral in the amount of 102% of the fair 
value of the loaned securities or (ii) in the case of loaned securities which are not denominated in United States Dollars, cash 
collateral in the amount of 105% of the fair value of the loaned securities.  Pursuant to the terms of the applicable securities loan 
agreement, BNYM shall, in accordance with BNYM’s reasonable and customary practices,  mark loaned securities to their fair 
value each business day based upon the fair value of the loaned securities as of the close of the preceding business day, employing 
the most recently available pricing information, and receive and deliver collateral in order to maintain the value of cash collateral 
at  no  less  than  the  collateral  requirement.    The  ATF  cannot  pledge  or  sell  collateral  securities  received  unless  the  borrower 
defaults.  As of September 30, 2010, the average term of the loans was 52 days.  Cash collateral investments are matured as needed 
to fulfill loan obligations.  All approved investments shall be for the account and risk of ATF.  To the extent any loss arising out of 
approved investments results in a deficiency in the amount of collateral available for return to a borrower, ATF agrees to pay 
BNYM on demand cash in an amount equal to such deficiency.

of the United States Government (“Government Securities”). 

  High-grade commercial paper, notes, bonds, and other debt obligations including promissory notes, funding agreements, 
and  guaranteed  investment  contracts  whether  or  not  registered  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended.    Such 
obligations may have fixed, floating, or variable rate interest payment provisions.  

  Asset-backed securities which carry the highest credit rating by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s. 
  Certificates of deposit, time deposits and other bank obligations of U.S. banks, their branches and subsidiaries.   
  Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by approved investments. 
  Securities, units, shares and other participations in money market funds, unregistered short-term investment funds, pools 

or trusts. 

  Government securities have no maturity limit.  Fixed rate instruments shall have a maturity of no greater than 13 months.  
Floating rate instruments rated “A” or “AA” shall have maturities no greater than three years with resets no less frequent 
than three months.  Floating rate instruments rated “AAA” shall have maturities no greater than five years with resets no 
less frequent than three months. 

 
The  Prepaid  Affordable  College  Tuition  Program’s  (PACT)  investment  policy  approved  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  permits  the 
PACT Program to enter into securities lending transactions defined as loans of securities to broker-dealers and other entities for 
collateral with a simultaneous agreement to return the collateral for the same securities in the future.  There are no restrictions on 
the amount of loans that can be made for the PACT Program. The PACT Program’s custodian, BNYM, administers the program 
and  acts  as  an  agent  for  the  PACT  Program.    Certain  securities  of  the  ATF  and  the  PACT  Program  are  loaned  to  borrowers 
approved  by  the  ATF  Board  of  Trustees  and  the  PACT  Program.    Approved  borrowers  of  securities  provide  acceptable  cash 
collateral in the form of federal funds or New York Clearing House funds as applicable for a particular loan.  The BNYM has 
provided  loss  indemnification  to  the  PACT  Program  in  the  event  that  the  borrower  does  not  return  the  market  value  of  the 
securities loaned.  The PACT program exited this program in June 2010.

E. Mortgage-Backed Securities 
The State of Alabama invests in mortgage-backed securities to improve yield and adjust the duration of the State’s fixed income 
portfolio.  Embedded prepayment options cause these investments to be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Prepayments 
of the underlying assets reduce the total interest payments to be received.  Generally, when interest rates fall, obligors tend to 
prepay  the  mortgages  thus  eliminating  the  stream  of  interest  payments  that  would  have  been  received  under  the  original 
amortization schedule.  The resulting reduction in cash flow diminishes the fair value of the mortgage-backed securities.  
 
The Alabama Trust Fund (ATF) invests in TBA (to be announced) purchase commitments, pursuant to which it agrees to purchase 
mortgage-backed securities.  The TBA market developed in response to the demands of market participants for more liquidity in 
trading mortgage-backed securities.  The TBA market is essentially a forward or delayed delivery market.  The lender, or other 
market participant, will enter into a forward contract to sell mortgage-backed securities in the TBA market, promising to deliver 
mortgage-backed securities on the settlement date sometime in the future.  At September 30, 2010, the ATF had investments in 
TBA mortgage-backed securities in the amounts of $58,530,000.  Included in investment purchases payable on the Statement of 
 

85 

STATE OF ALABAMA 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
Net Assets is a liability related to the cost of acquiring these securities.  Generally, these securities are closed with a gain or loss 
prior to settlement.  However, the ATF would be obligated for those amounts should the securities be delivered. 

F. Capital Assets 
Historical  costs  for  infrastructure  assets  are  included  in  this  report.    The  State  elected  to  include  the  historical  costs  of  all 
infrastructure  assets,  not  just  assets  capitalized  since  1980,  as  required  by  GASB  Statement  No.  34.    The  State  capitalizes 
infrastructure when all costs for a project are incurred and all project documentation is completed and filed with the appropriate 
entities.  Due to the documentation requirements, there can be substantial time lags between the date a project is put into service 
and the date the project is capitalized.  A significant portion of Infrastructure Construction in Progress consists of projects that 
have been put into service and maintenance costs could have been incurred but the project documentation is not complete.  As of 
September 30, 2010, the capital assets for the Primary Government and the Component Units are presented in the following tables:

G. Derivatives 
Alabama State Port Authority - In December 2002, the Alabama State Port Authority entered into a swaption contract with an 
investment  company  in  order  to  monetize  potential  debt  service  savings  on  the  Authority’s  callable  1996  Series  bond.    The 
swaption  gave  the  counterparty  the  option  to  enter  into  a  variable-to-fixed  interest  rate  swap  at  a  specified  future  date.    The 
counterparty exercised its option on July 18, 2006 and the interest rate swap commenced on October 1, 2006, with the Authority 
paying a fixed interest rate (5.38%) and the Authority receiving a variable interest rate (67% of the one-month LIBOR).  The 
Authority may be exposed to various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk through the interest rate swap.  As the interest 
rate swap is a liability at September 30, 2010 and 2009, the impact of credit risk is minimized.  The swap agreement is based on an 
original notional amount of $60,125,000, valued at $59,950,000 at September 30, 2010, and expires on October 1, 2021.  Upon 
exercising of the option by the counterparty, the Authority issued variable-rate refunding bonds in an amount sufficient to refund 
the  fixed  rate  Series  1996  revenue  bonds.    As  of  September  30,  2010,  the  interest  rate  swap  had  a  negative  fair  value  of 
approximately $16,069,000 and is recorded in the accompanying financial statements in accordance with GASB Statement No. 53 
as an investment derivative instrument.  The interest rate swap value is calculated using an industry accepted option pricing model 
that uses market interest rates and volatility assumptions on the valuation date.  The interest rate and volatility data is used to 
calculate the present value of the potential future cash flows of the swap.   
 
University of South Alabama - In January 2008, the University of South Alabama entered into a synthetic advance refunding of the 
outstanding Series 2004 and 2006 bonds with a counterparty.  This transaction was effected through the sale of two swaptions by 
the University to the counterparty.  The transactions resulted in an up-front payment to the University totaling $9,328,000, which 
was recorded as a liability, in exchange for selling the counterparty the option to enter into an interest rate swap with respect to the 
Series 2004 and 2006 bonds in 2014 and 2016, respectively.  The objective of this transaction is to realize debt service savings 
currently from future debt refunding and create an economic benefit to the University.  If the counterparty exercises its options in 
2016 and 2016, the University would, at the counterparty’s option, be forced into an underlying swap.  If the option is exercised, 
the University would begin to make payments on the notional amount, currently $41,125,000 and $100,000,000 for the 2004 bonds 
and 2006 bonds, respectively, of the underlying swap contract.  Simultaneously, the University would call outstanding 2004 and 
2006 bonds and issue variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) in their place.  Under the swap contract, the University would pay a 
fixed rate of 4.9753% on the 2004 bonds and 5.0% on the 2006 bonds to the counterparty and would receive payments based on 
68% of the one-month LIBOR index.  Alternatively, although it is not anticipated that this option would be to the University’s 
advantage, the University could, at its option, cash settle the swap and retain its right to refund the 2004 and 2006 bonds.  If the 
interest rate environment is such that the counterparty chooses to not exercise its option, the swaptions would be canceled and the 
University would have no further obligation under this agreement.  A swaption is considered a hybrid instrument and as such the 
payment by the counterparty to the University must be bifurcated into two components, a borrowing component and an embedded 
derivative component, and each component treated separately.  The embedded derivative value of the swaptions represents the fair 
value resulting from the fact that the fixed rate stated in the swaptions is greater that the at-the-market rate.  The initial value of the 
borrowing is the difference between the upfront payment and the fair value of the embedded derivative and represents the time 
value  to  the  counterparty  for  holding  the  option,  or  the  probability  weighted,  discounted  values  of  a  range  of  future  possible 
outcomes.    The  values  of  the  derivative  and  borrowings  at  the  date  of  execution  of  this  transaction  are  embedded  derivatives 
$918,000 for 2004 bonds and $3,343,000 for 2006 bonds and borrowings of $1,070,000 for 2004 bonds and $3,997,000 for 2006 
bonds.  The values of the borrowings are included in long-tem debt on the University’s 2010 and 2009 statements of net assets.  
Interest  is  being  accreted  on,  and  added  to,  the  borrowing  through  the  expiration  date  of  the  option.    The  fair  values  of  the 
embedded investment derivatives are reported as noncurrent liabilities.  The change in the fair market values of the derivatives is 
reported as a component of investment income in the statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets.  At September 
30, 2010, the fair values of the derivatives are approximately $(13,327,000) and are included in other long-term liabilities in the 
accompanying statements of net assets.  For the year ended September 30, 2010, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
were $(3,344,000). 
 
Fair Value.  At September 30, 2010, the embedded derivatives had fair values of $(13,327,000).  The fair values of the embedded 
derivatives were estimated using the zero-coupon method.  This method calculates the future net settlement payments required by 
the instruments, assuming that the current forward rates implied by the yield curve correctly anticipate future spot interest rates.  
These payments are then discounted using the spot rates implied by the current yield curve for hypothetical zero-coupon bonds due 
on the date of each future net settlement. 
   
Interest  Rate  Risk.    Interest  rate  risk,  as  a  result  of  rising  short-term  interest  rates  causing  higher  interest  rate  payments,  is 
effectively  hedged  by  the  University’s  fixed  rate  bonds.    If  the  counterparty  exercises  its  options,  the  underlying  swaps  are 
expected to effectively hedge the potentially higher payments on VRDNs as well.  The University is also subject to interest rate 
risk, as a result of changes in long term interest rates, which may cause the value of fixed rate bonds or interest rate derivatives to

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
change.  If long term interest rates fall subsequent to the execution of this transaction, the value of the swaptions will change, with 
negative consequences for the University.   
 
Market Access Risk.  This transaction assumes that VRDNs will be issued as a replacement of the 2004 and 2006 bonds.  If the 
University is unable to issue variable rate bonds after the counterparty exercises its right under the swaptions, the University would 
still be required to begin making periodic payments on the swaps, even thought there are no related bonds.  Alternatively, the 
University could choose to liquidate the swaps, which may create a substantial cash outlay. 
 
Basis Risk.  If the counterparty exercises its option, there is a risk that the floating payments received under the swaps will not 
fully offset the variable rate payments due on the assumed VRDNs. 
 
Credit Risk.  Although the underlying swap exposes the University to credit risk should the swap be executed, the swaption itself 
does not expose the University to credit risk.  If the option is exercised on one or both issues, the University would begin to make 
payments on the appropriate notional amount of the underlying swap contract.  In that situation, if the fair value of the swap is 
positive, the University would be exposed to credit risk on the swap in the amount of its fair value.  As of September 30, 2009, the 
swap counterparty was rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Services and AA by Standard and Poors Rating Services. 
 
Termination Risk.  The University may be required to terminate the swaptions or swaps under certain circumstances, such as credit 
downgrades or other events specified in the contracts.  In the event that a position needs to be terminated, the University may owe 
a substantial amount of money to terminate the contracts.  At September 30, 2010, no events of termination have occurred.  
 
Alabama Public School and College Authority (Authority) - The Authority and JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan) entered into a 
Master  Agreement  dated  March  13,  2002  (the  "Swap  Option  Agreement"),  with  respect  to  the  Authority's  Series  1998  Bonds, 
Series  1999-A  Bonds,  Series  1999-C  Bonds,  and  Series  1999-D  Bonds  (collectively,  the  "Swap  Bonds").  The  Swap  Option 
Agreement  was  subsequently  amended  on  January  16,  2003.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Swap  Option  Agreement,  the  Authority 
received certain lump sum payments in the amount of $12,587,000 from JPMorgan in return for an option to enter into fixed payer 
interest rate swaps with respect to each of the Swap Bonds in the notional amounts of $283,715,000 with respect to the Series 1998 
Bonds,  $18,675,000  with  respect  to  the  Series  1999-A  Bonds,  $254,125,000  with  respect  to  the  Series  1999-C  Bonds  and 
$153,700,000 with respect to the Series 1999-D Bonds. Such option is exercisable by JPMorgan upon 150 days prior written notice 
on November 1 in the years 2008 through 2011 for the Series 1998 Bonds, September 1 in the years 2009 and 2010 for the Series 
1999-A Bonds, July 1 in the years 2009 through 2011 for the Series 1999-C Bonds, and on August 1 in the years 2009 through 
2011 for the Series 1999-D Bonds. JPMorgan notified the Authority of its intention to exercise its option with respect to the Series 
1998 Bonds, effective November 1, 2008, the effect of which under the Swap Option Agreement would have been to require the 
Authority  to  issue  variable  rate  bonds  for  the  purpose  of  refunding  the  Series  1998  Bonds.    The  Swap  Option  Agreement  is 
currently  in  litigation  and  no  payments  have  been  made  and  accepted.    (See  Litigation  Note)  By  letter  dated  May  14,  2009, 
JPMorgan notified the Authority that it was seeking $122,008,804 in termination payments allegedly due under the Swap Option 
Agreement.  As of September 30, 2010, the Swap Option Agreement had a value of approximately $(32,412,152).  The valuations 
were calculated mathematical approximations of market values derived from proprietary models as of September 30, 2010.  The 
valuations were calculated on a mid-market basis and do not include bid/offer spread that would be reflected in an actual price 
quotation.  The fair value is reported in other noncurrent liabilities on the Statement of Net Assets.  The change in the fair market 
values of the derivative of $43,147,714 gain is reported on the Statement of Activities as investment earnings.      
 
The  Retirement  Systems  of  Alabama  (RSA)  -  The  RSA  enters  into  call  and  put  options.    The  RSA  uses  these  derivative 
instruments to make an investment, control risk with certain investment positions, or as a yield enhancement strategy.  During the 
fiscal  year,  these  investments  were  used  exclusively  within  the  RSA’s  domestic  and  international  equity  portfolios  and  are 
presented in the financial statements in their respective equity classifications.  These derivative instruments are either listed options 
or  executed  in  the  over-the-counter  (OTC)  market  using  only  credit  worthy  counterparties.    The  fair  value  of  the  investment 
derivatives are based on market prices.  Investment risks related to investment derivatives have been considered and included in 
the respective investment risks notes above in Note 3.C..

Alabama Trust Fund (ATF)  - Derivatives can be used by the ATF’s investment managers to manage cash positions, gain broad 
stock or bond market exposure and to manage risks with certain investment positions.  ATF Investment Policy allows derivative 
instruments  to  be  used  provided  that  the  collateral  is  held  in  highly  liquid  securities  and  that  they  do  not  create  the  effect  of 
leverage in the portfolio. 
 
GASB Statement No. 53 requires that the fair value of the financial arrangements called “derivatives” or “derivative instruments” 
be  reported  in  the  financial  statements  of  state  and  local  governments.    The  statement  further  requires  that  derivatives  be 
categorized as either an investment derivative or a hedge derivative.  All of the ATF’s derivative exposures as of September 30, 
2010, are categorized as investment derivatives and therefore the hedge accounting provisions of GASB Statement No. 53 are not 
applicable. 
 
All derivative instruments are presented in the financial statements and are reported at fair value.  ATF’s custodian Bank of New 
York Mellon (BNYM) uses market prices when available.  BNYM used two vendors to value derivatives when market values are 
not available.  The two vendors used by BNYM are Markit, and SuperDerivatives.  Both vendors consider their valuation process 
to be proprietary and not available for disclosure.  Investment risks related to investment derivatives have been considered and 
included in the respective investment risks notes above in Note 3.C..

At September 30, 2010, Jacksonville State University had commitments on construction projects of $1,549,000. 

2. Operating Leases 
The State and its component units have entered into various lease agreements for real property.  These leases do not represent 
material commitments by the State, therefore disclosure of minimum future lease payments is not provided. 

3. Economic Development 
The  State  and  its  component  units  have  made  a  variety  of  economic  development  grant  commitments  to  the  private  sector  to 
finance the cost of industries locating and expanding in the State, as well as the training costs of employees.   

a. Primary Government 
The State has committed to economic development grants totaling $308,343,000 as of September 30, 2010.  It is expected that in 
fiscal  year  2011,  $23,752,000  of  commitments  will  be  paid  from  appropriations,  $17,291,000  from  prior  year  carry  forward

4. Other Commitments 
The Alabama Housing Finance Authority, a component unit, has designated $69,640,000 of its unrestricted net assets for fiscal 
year  September  30,  2010  for  funding  of  future  single-family  mortgage  revenue  bond  programs,  to  support  its  single-family 
mortgage loan origination and warehousing operations, and to cover its operating expense budget for the following fiscal year. 

B. Claims and Judgments 
A judgment was entered against the State in favor of Alabama State University and Alabama A&M University.  The State paid 
each University the final payment of $1,000,000 this year, so the total amount outstanding is $0.  The Education Trust Fund was 
used to liquidate this debt. 
 
A  settlement  agreement  was  made  between  the  State  and  BellSouth  Telecommunications,  Inc.  regarding  Alabama’s 
unconstitutional foreign franchise tax.   The State must pay BellSouth $4,767,000 for the next year in the form of actual payments 
and tax credits.  The amount outstanding is $4,767,000.  The General Fund is being used to liquidate this debt. 

C. Conduit Debt  
Troy  University,  a  component  unit,  issued  Special  Limited  Obligation  Revenue  Bonds  Series  1997  to  provide  athletic  facility 
improvements for Sartain Hall and Memorial Stadium.  The total amount of outstanding conduit debt as of September 30, 2010 is 
$4,110,000.  The bonds are limited obligations of the City of Troy and are payable entirely from the amounts received under the 
indenture.  The bonds do not constitute a debt or pledge of faith and credit of the University or the State of Alabama, and it is not 
reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
 
Revenue  bonds  were  issued  by  Alabama  Housing  Financing  Authority,  a  component  unit,  which  constituted  conduit  debt 
outstanding at year-end totaling $201,060,000 to provide multifamily housing for the citizens of Alabama. The Authority does not 
actively monitor the operating performance or financial condition of the multifamily properties financed by the bonds. Multifamily 
mortgage  loans  are  collateralized  by  varying  methods,  including  first-liens  on  multifamily  residential  rental  properties  located 
within the State of Alabama, letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees provided by third parties. These bonds do not constitute 
a debt or pledge of the faith and credit of the Authority or the State of Alabama, and accordingly, have not been reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. 

D. Long-term Debt 

1. Debt Limitations and Methods of Bond Issuance 
Under Section 213 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as modified by Amendment 26, the State is constitutionally prohibited 
from incurring debt except to repel invasion or suppress insurrection.  Therefore, the only method under which general obligation 
debt can be incurred is by amendment to the Constitution.  Although conventions proposed by the legislature and approved by the 
electorate  may  be  called  for  the  purpose  of  amending  the  Constitution,  historically  all  amendments  have  been  adopted  by  a 
procedure which requires them to be proposed by a three-fifths majority of each house of the legislature and thereafter ratified by a 
majority of the electorate. 
 
The Supreme Court of Alabama has ruled that the debt prohibition does not apply to debts incurred by separate public corporations 
functioning as state instrumentalities.  The State has followed the practice of financing certain capital improvements by issuing 
debt through such public corporations.  The legislature (through enabling legislation) and the Governor (by executive order) have 
created  public  corporations  and  authorities  of  the  State  for  the  purpose  of  financing  projects  and  programs  such  as  public 
highways, public educational facilities, judicial buildings, student loans, affordable housing, economic development grants, and 
other projects.  In most instances, state officials such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, State Treasurer, 
and the Director of Finance serve as board members of these corporations.  The revenue bonds issued by these corporations are 
limited obligations of the corporation, not general obligations of the State, and the full faith and credit of the State is not pledged 
for their repayment.  Certain revenues, usually earmarked taxes or revenues generated from the project financed, are pledged for 
the  payment  of  the  debt.    Depending  on  the  GASB  criteria  discussed  in  Note  1,  some  of  these  corporations  are  reported  by 
blending  them  with  the  primary  government  and  some  are  reported  discretely.    The  State  also  enters  into  lease  purchase 
agreements which are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as capital lease debt or notes payable.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
The State and its component units issue serial and term bonds and capital appreciation bonds.  Capital appreciation bonds are sold 
at a deep discount and do not pay any interest until the bonds mature.  Based on the original offering price, the bonds increase in 
value as semi-annual interest is earned and is compounded from the original issuance date to the date of maturity.  The issuance of 
this type bond postpones the cash flow until the bonds mature or are called.  The increase in the value of the bonds is referred to as 
accretion. 

2. General Obligation Bonds – Governmental Activities 
The State has general obligation bond issues outstanding for the purpose of financing major capital projects for:  state waterways, 
State Port Authority’s facilities, prisons, roads, bridges, mental hospitals, Mobile harbor, state parks, youth services facilities, state 
buildings,  the  State  Coliseum,  conservation  and  preservation  projects,  educational  television,  forensic  sciences  laboratories, 
agricultural development, diagnostic and research laboratories, and historical projects.  General obligation bonds also finance grant 
programs for public school and college buildings, as well as economic development grants to industry and local government.  The 
full faith and credit of the State is pledged for the payment of the bonds.  The following schedule shows the general obligation 
annual  debt  service  requirements  and  is  followed  by  a  detailed  table  describing  each  individual  general  obligation  bond  issue 
outstanding:

4. Refunded Bonds  
Advance refunding bonds are issued to retire existing bonds.  A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the refunding bonds is 
deposited with an escrow agent according to an escrow trust agreement.  The proceeds are invested by the escrow agent in certain 
U.S.  Treasury  obligations  in  such  amounts  with  certain  maturities  to  provide  sufficient  funds  to  pay  the  remaining  maturing 
principal and interest on the refunded bonds as they become due.  The refunded bond debt is considered to be retired for financial 
reporting purposes even though the debt is still legally outstanding and the issuer of the bonds has not been released from the debt 
obligations.  The U.S. Treasury obligations constitute a trust fund to be held by the escrow agent for the benefit of the holders of 
the refunded bonds.  Advance refundings and early redemptions are discussed in the remainder of this section.

5. Arbitrage 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that governmental entities issuing tax-exempt debt subsequent to August 1986, to calculate 
and  rebate  arbitrage  earnings  to  the  federal  government.    The  U.S.  Treasury  has  issued  regulations  on  calculating  the  rebate 
amount and complying with the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Governmental issuers must comply with the rebate 
regulation in order for their bonds to maintain tax-exempt status. 
 
The regulations require the excess of the aggregate amount earned on investments purchased with bond proceeds over the amount 
that would have been earned if the proceeds were invested at a rate equal to the bond yield to be rebated to the federal government.  
Income earned on excess earnings is also subject to rebate.  Rebate payments, if required, are due at least once every five years 
over the life of the bonds.  Bond issues with arbitrage liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2010, were as follows: 

Component Units
Water Pollution Control Authority
Housing Finance Authority

Amount
2,400,510
3,301,000

$      
        

These lists are based upon incomplete data since some bond issues have not yet been included in arbitrage calculations.  Any 
refunded  bond  issue  is  subject  to  the  rebate  requirement  until  the  last  bond  is  redeemed.    Bond  issues  that  have  already  been 
redeemed may be subject to additional payments if an arbitrage rebate or spending payment is owed and has not been paid.

7. Derivative Transactions 
University of South Alabama - On February 27, 2007, the University of South Alabama Research and Technology Corporation 
entered into a derivative transaction with Wachovia Bank, N.A.  The derivative is a “receive variable, pay fixed” interest rate swap 
entered  into  in  connection  with  the  promissory  note  that  came  into  effect  upon  conversion  of  the  construction  loan  into  a 
permanent loan on May 1, 2008.  The Corporation utilizes the interest rate swap to convert its variable rate on the promissory note 
to a synthetic fixed rate.  The promissory note came into effect on May 1, 2008, upon conversion of the construction loan.  Also, 
on May 1, 2008, the interest rate swap associated with the loan became effective.  The swap will terminate on My 1, 2028, when 
the loan matures.  The notional amount of the swap will at all times match the outstanding principal amount of the loan.  Under the 
swap, the Corporation pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 6.10% and receives a variable payment of the one-month LIBOR 
rate  plus  0.85%.    The  Corporation  paid  $864,000  and  $756,000  under  the  interest  rate  swap  agreement  for  the  years  ended

For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is reflected as an increase in interest expense. 
 
Fair Value.  The interest rate swap had a fair value of $(4,171,030) at September 30, 2010.  The changes in fair value are reported 
as a deferred outflow on the Statement of Net Assets since the interest rate swap is a hedging derivative instrument.  The fair value 
of the interest rate swap was estimated using the zero-coupon method.  This method calculates the future net settlement payments 
required by the swap, assuming that the current forward rates implied by the yield curve correctly anticipate future spot interest 
rates.  These payments are then discounted using the spot rates implied by the current yield curve for hypothetical zero-coupon 
bonds due on the date of each future net settlement. 
 
Interest Rate Risk.  On the Corporation’s “receive-variable, pay-fixed” interest rate swap, as LIBOR decreases, the net payment on 
the swap increases. 
 
Credit Risk.  As of September 30, 2010 the Corporation was not exposed to credit risk on the interest rate swap because it had a 
negative fair value.  However, if interest rates change and the fair value of the derivative becomes positive, the Corporation would 
have a gross exposure to credit risk in the amount of the derivatives’ fair value.  The counterparty was rated Aa2 by Moody’s 
Investors Services and AA by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services as of September 30, 2010. 
 
Termination  Risk.    The  interest  rate  swap  contracts  use  the  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association,  Inc.  Master 
Agreement, which includes standard default and termination events, such as failure to make payments, breach of agreement, and 
bankruptcy.  At September 30, 2010, no events of default or termination had occurred.  If the interest rate swap is terminated, 
interest rate risk associated with the variable rate debt would no longer be hedged.  Also, if at the time of termination the interest 
rate swap had a negative fair value, the Corporation would be liable to the counterparty for a payment equal to the interest rate 
swap’s fair value.  To allow the Corporation the maximum flexibility to manage the utilization of Building II and III while at the 
same time providing protection for the counterparty, the Corporation granted the counterparty a $2,000,000 mortgage secured by 
an interest in the ground lease with respect to the parcel of land on which Building II stands, an interest in Building II, a security 
interest in Building II tenant leases and a security interest in income received from rental of Building II.

The State leases office buildings and equipment with varying terms and options.  Most buildings under capital lease have a term of 
twenty-five to thirty years, but can range from twenty to forty years.  Capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present value 
of  the  future  minimum  lease  payments  or  fair  market  value.    Principal  and  interest  capital  lease  payments  are  recorded  as 
expenditures  of  the  applicable  governmental  function  in  the  governmental  fund.    The  largest  capital  leases  in  governmental 
activities are for buildings in county facilities used by the Department of Public Health and the Department of Human Resources.

Transfers are often made between funds as required by the legislature in the appropriation acts as well as by a variety of existing 
statutes.  Of the $224,792,000 transferred to other funds by the General Fund, $204,913,000 was transferred in compliance with 
the  appropriation  acts.    Of  that  amount,  $97,897,000  was  transferred  to  the  Public  Welfare  Trust  Fund,  $61,307,000  was 
transferred to various Nonmajor Governmental Funds and $36,420,000 was transferred to the Department of Public Health.  The 
remaining General Fund transfers were made in small amounts to comply with a variety of statutes.   
 
Of  the  $381,258,000  transferred  out  of  the  Education  Trust  Fund,  the  appropriation  acts  as  adjusted  by  proration  required  the 
transfer  of  $369,194,000  to  other  funds.    Of  that  amount,  $338,945,000  was  transferred  to  supplement  the  operations  of  the 
Alabama  College  System.    The  appropriation  acts  also  mandated  that  the  Internal  Service  Funds  receive  $1,119,000  to  fund 
telephone and computer services and the Public Welfare Trust Fund received $12,673,000.  The remaining Education Trust Fund 
transfers were made in small amounts to comply with a variety of statutes.  
  
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board transferred $12,766,000 to the General Fund and $430,000 to the Public Welfare Trust 
Fund, which represents those funds’ statutorily mandated share of the Board’s profits.  
 
The Alabama Trust Fund, in compliance with amendments to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, is required to transfer to other 
funds a substantial portion of its investment earnings as well as a portion of new income from offshore oil and gas rights.  In 
compliance  with  these  amendments,  the  General  Fund received $64,387,000,  and  the  Nonmajor Governmental  Funds received 
$139,040,000.  Within the Nonmajor Governmental Funds, the Forever Wild Land Trust Fund received $10,140,000, the County 
Government Capital Improvement Fund received $12,948,000, the Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund received 
$12,948,000,  the  Alabama  Capital  Improvement  Trust  Fund  received  $49,313,000,  the  County  and  Municipal  Capital

NOTE 6 - RISK MANAGEMENT 

 
The State manages risk through risk control and risk financing to minimize the adverse effects of certain types of losses.  Risk 
financing includes self-insurance through several different funds.  The State Insurance Fund provides coverage for state buildings 
and contents against fire and casualty losses.  The General Liability Trust Fund insures state employees against the risk of loss 
from  employment-related  liability  claims.    The  State  Employee  Injury  Compensation  Trust  Fund  was  created  by  the  1994 
legislature to provide benefits to eligible state employees for job-incurred injury.  The State Insurance Fund, the General Liability 
Trust Fund, and the State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund are administered by the Division of Risk Management of the 
Department of Finance. 
 
There was no significant reduction in insurance coverage by the three Division of Risk Management funds from the prior year.  
These  funds  do  not  have  acquisition  costs;  therefore,  no  cost  is  amortized  for  the  period.    The  funds  use  the  accrual  basis  of 
accounting for reporting purposes.  As required by GASB Statement No. 31, “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain 
Investments  and  External  Investment  Pools,”  most  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value.    Liabilities  are  reported  when  it  is 
probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated.  Liabilities include an amount for claims 
that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR).  Because actual claims liabilities depend on such complex factors as inflation, 
changes in legal doctrines, and damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in an 
exact amount.  Claims liabilities are reevaluated periodically to take into consideration recently settled claims, the frequency of 
claims, and other economic and social factors.  Estimated claims liabilities are calculated by the plans’ actuary based on prior 
claims data for the General Liability Trust Fund and State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund.  For the State Insurance 
Fund, estimated claims liabilities are based on management’s judgment.  Non-incremental claims adjustment expenses have not 
been included as part of the liability for any of the funds. 
 
The separately issued financial report of the Division of Risk Management contains additional note disclosures and supplementary 
information regarding claims development and liabilities.

A. The State Insurance Fund 
The State Insurance Fund (SIF) was established in 1923 and is under the Code of Alabama 1975, Section 41-15-1 for the purpose 
of insuring direct physical loss on buildings and contents in which title in whole or in part is vested in the State of Alabama or any 
of its agencies or institutions or in which funds provided by the State have been used for the purchases of land, construction of 
buildings,  purchase  or  maintenance  of  any  equipment,  machinery,  furniture,  fixtures  or  supplies  in  such  buildings  and  public 
school  buildings  together  with  the  contents  of  all  such  buildings.  All  covered  property  shall  be  insured  for  no  more  than  its 
replacement cost and shall be insured for no less than 80 percent of its actual cash value.  Ten percent of actual cash value, salvage 
value, is used for property that is normally uninsurable.  City boards of education may insure school buildings and property either 
in the State Insurance Fund or with an insurance company, whichever in the opinion of such board provides the best coverage for 
such school buildings and property.  The principles of private industry insurance companies are utilized to establish rates, premium 
discounts, and experience credits to result in equitable premiums charged to policyholders.  Excess insurance and reinsurance is 
acquired to assure the solvency of the fund. 
 
Losses are recorded as current liabilities and expenses in the year reported.  IBNR recognizes losses that have occurred but have 
not yet been reported.  This liability and expense is determined by a professional actuary.  The SIF has a $10,000,000 cumulative 
loss  annual  deductible  and  a  $3,500,000  specific  loss  deductible  for  all  perils  except  named  wind  storms,  and  a  $10,000,000 
specific loss deductible for named wind storms.  Excess insurance covers claims exceeding the deductible with a $1,000,000,000 
limit.    Payments  received  in  fiscal  years  2010,  2009,  and  2008  for  settlements  in  excess  of  deductibles  totaled  $2,273,9751, 
$14,166,000, and $14,655,000 respectively.

B. General Liability Trust Fund 
The  General  Liability  Trust  Fund  (GLTF)  was  established  in  1984  to  protect  state  employees  from  personal  financial  liability 
resulting from lawsuits that are based on alleged negligence while acting within the line and scope of state employment.  Claims 
are investigated and defended through the Office of the Attorney General.  Auto liability is fully  reinsured and the re-insurer, 
American Southern Insurance Company, handles all claims.  The GLTF is managed much like a commercial insurance company, 
with exposure evaluated and commensurate premiums assigned to state agencies.  Investment activities are an essential part of the 
General Liability Trust Fund’s ability to maintain lower-cost employee liability coverage.  Funds in excess of those needed for 
immediate operations are invested to maximize return and keep premiums down. 
 
Losses are recorded as current liabilities and expenses in the year reported.  IBNR recognizes losses that have occurred but have 
not yet been reported.  This liability and expense is determined by a professional actuary.  Excess insurance was not renewed in 
April 2002, so the GLTF is currently without excess coverage. Payments received in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for settlements in 
excess of deductibles for old claims (prior to April 2002) totaled $2,833,932 and $0, respectively.

C. State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund 
The State Employee Injury Compensation Trust Fund (SEICTF) was created by the legislature on October 1, 1994.  Its purpose is 
to provide benefits to eligible state employees for job-incurred injury.  Benefits under SEICTF are administered by the Department 
of  Finance,  Division  of  Risk  Management  in  accordance  with  the  Alabama  Administrative  Code  and  include  all  reasonable 
medical expenses arising from a job-incurred injury, lost wages (including benefits for time lost from the job), and benefits to 
dependents of employees who are fatally injured on the job.  Specifically excluded from coverage are employees of the State Port 
Authority, educational institutions, and local boards of education.  A key element in assuring effective and efficient operation of 
SEICTF  was  the  creation  of  a  statewide  medical  provider  network  with  a  focus  on  professionals  who  are  experts  in  treating 
occupational injury.   
 
Losses are recorded as current liabilities and expenses in the year reported.  IBNR recognizes losses that have occurred but have 
not been reported.  This liability and expense is determined by a professional actuary.

D. State Employees' Insurance Plan 
The State Employees' Insurance Plan (SEIP) was established in 1965 by Alabama Act No. 833 to provide health insurance benefits 
for state employees.  The SEIP is administered by the State Employees' Insurance Board (SEIB).  The monthly premiums for 
employee and dependent coverage are determined annually and are set at a rate necessary to provide sufficient funds to pay all 
claims  and  reasonable  expenses  of  administering  the  plans.    The  State  pays  a  monthly  premium  for  each  employee  and  the 
employee pays the established dependent premium.  The SEIB establishes claims liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost 
of claims (including future retroactive claims adjustments) that have been reported but not settled, and of estimated claims that 
have been incurred but not reported.  Because actual claims liabilities are affected by complex changing factors such as inflation, 
medical technology, and changes in legal doctrines, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not result in an exact 
amount.  Actual claims costs incurred may vary from estimated claims liabilities depending on the similarities in the nature and 
frequency of the claims between current and prior years.  Adjustments of the estimated claims liabilities based on actual results are 
charged or credited to expense in the periods in which such adjustments are determined. 
 
The SEIB also administers a local government health insurance plan (LGHIP) in the same manner as the SEIP.  The following 
table represents changes in those aggregate liabilities for SEIB during the years ended September 30 (approximately 59% of claim 
liabilities are related to the SEIP and the remainder to the LGHIP):

E. Public Education Employees' Health Insurance 
The Public Education Employees' Health Insurance Fund (PEEHIF) was established in 1983 by the provisions of Act 83-455 to 
provide a uniform plan of health insurance for current and retired employees of public educational institutions and to provide a 
method of funding the benefits related to the plan.  The plan is administered by the Public Education Employees' Health Insurance 
Board (PEEHIB). 
 
The State contributes a specified amount monthly to each respective participating school system.  Each participating school system 
must then pay the employer rate to the PEEHIF each month.  That rate was $752 per participant for 2010 and 2009.  In addition to 
the employer payments each month, the employee pays certain premium amounts.  PEEHIB established claims liabilities based on 
the actual cost of claims reported but not settled, and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported.  Because actual 
claims liabilities are affected by complex changing factors such as inflation, medical technology, and changes in legal doctrines, 
the process used in computing claims liabilities does not result in an exact amount.  Actual claims costs ultimately incurred may 
vary from the estimated claims liabilities depending on the similarities in the nature and frequency of the claims between current 
and prior years.  Adjustments to claims liabilities are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which they are made. Note 
that $419,000 of unpaid claims at year-end is classified as due to the primary government.

F. Alabama Health Insurance Plan 
The Alabama Health Insurance Plan (AHIP) was established to provide health insurance coverage to eligible individuals as an 
alternative to federal oversight required in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  AHIP was established 
in 1997 under Regulation 115 pursuant to Act 97-713, codified as Section 27-52-1 in the Code of Alabama 1975, and is governed 
by an eight member Board of Directors.  The plan provides major medical benefits limited to $1,000,000 for the lifetime of a 
participant.  The plan provides that participants pay monthly premiums for health insurance coverage.  Coverage is also available 
for eligible dependents of participants.  Premiums are determined annually and are set at a rate necessary to provide sufficient 
funds to pay all claims and reasonable expenses of administering the plan. 
 
Regulation  No.  115  authorizes  the  Plan  to  recoup  losses  by  assessing  participating  insurers  based  on  their  health  insurance 
premiums written in the state for any year in which the Plan incurs a deficit.  Assessments in excess of actual losses are to be held 
in interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce future assessments.  AHIP obtained funding from assessments 
totaling $3,901,000 and $3,829,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
 
AHIP  established  claims  liabilities  based  on  estimates  of  the  ultimate  cost  of  claims  (including  future  retroactive  claims 
adjustments)  that  have  been  reported  but  not  settled  and  of  estimated  claims  that  have  been  incurred  but  not  reported.    The 
estimation of claims costs depends on many factors including historical loss experience.  Adjustments of the estimated claims 
liabilities based on actual results are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which such adjustments are determined.

NOTE 7 - RETIREMENT PLANS 

A. Retirement Systems of Alabama 
The Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) administers the following three retirement programs for the benefit of state employees 
and public education employees: Teachers’ Retirement System, Employees’ Retirement System, and Judicial Retirement Fund.   

1. Plan Descriptions 
The Teachers' Retirement System of Alabama (TRS) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan, established 
as of September 15, 1939, under the provisions of the 1939 Alabama Acts 419.  The TRS provides retirement allowances and other 
specified  benefits  for  qualified  persons  employed  by  State-supported  educational  institutions.    The  Board  of  Control  has 
responsibility for the general administration and operation of the TRS. 
 
The Employees' Retirement System of Alabama (ERS) is an agent multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan established as 
of October 1, 1945, under  the  provisions of  the  1945  Alabama  Acts  515.    The  ERS provides  retirement  allowances  and other 
specified  benefits  for  state  employees,  state  police,  and  on  an  elective  basis,  to  all  cities,  counties,  towns,  and  quasi-public 
organizations.  The Board of Control is responsible for the general administration and operation of the ERS.   
 
The Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan, established under the 1973 
Alabama Acts 1163.  The JRF provides retirement allowances and other specified benefits for any Justice of the Supreme Court of 
Alabama, Judge of the Court of Civil Appeals, Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, Judge of the Circuit Court, or office holder 
of any newly created judicial office receiving compensation from the State Treasury.  Act Number 1205 of the legislature of 1975 
supplemented the provisions of Act Number 1163 and enlarged the scope and coverage of the JRF to include District and Probate 
Judges.  The Board of Control of the ERS administers and operates the JRF.   
 
The TRS, ERS, and JRF provide retirement benefits as well as death and disability benefits as established by State law.  Changes 
to benefits, including ad hoc cost of living adjustments, must be established by statute.  Benefits for TRS and ERS members vest 
after 10 years of credited service.  Teachers and state employees who retire after age 60 (52 for state police) with 10 years of 
credited service or with 25 years of service (regardless of age) are entitled to an annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for 
life.  Service retirement benefits are calculated by two methods with the member receiving payment under the method which yields 
the highest monthly benefit:  (1) minimum guaranteed, or (2) formula.  Under the formula method, members of TRS and ERS 
(except  state  police)  are  allowed  2.0125  percent  of  their  final  average  salary  (highest  3  of  the  last  10  years)  for  each  year  of 

 

122 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
service.  State police are allowed 2.875 percent for each year of state police service in computing the formula method.  Disability 
retirement benefits are calculated in the same manner.  
 
JRF benefits vest from five to eighteen years.  Except for justices or judges who were either disabled, elected prior to July 30, 
1979, or have at least 25 years of credited service, no justice or judge shall be eligible to receive judicial service retirement pay 
prior to attaining sixty years of age.  Service retirement benefits for justices and judges are dependent upon the particular office 
held in the judicial branch of government.  A retirement benefit is payable upon the request of any member who has:  (1) 25 years 
of credited service (regardless of age), (2) completed 12 years of credited service and has attained age 65, (3) completed 15 years 
of credited service and whose age plus service equals or exceeds 77, (4) completed at least 18 years of credited service or three full 
terms as a judge or justice and has attained age 65 (5) completed 10 years of credited service and has attained age 70, (6) been 
elected prior to July 30, 1979 and has 18 years of service (regardless of age).  A member eligible to retire who has not requested 
his retirement benefit to commence at the end of the term in which his seventieth birthday occurs is entitled only to the refund of 
his  contributions  (except  for  members  with  at  least  25  years  of  credited  service).    The  service  retirement  benefit  for  circuit, 
appellate, and probate judges is 75% of the member’s salary at the time of separation from service.  The service retirement benefit 
for a district judge is 75% of the position’s salary immediately prior to retirement. 
 
A  pre-retirement  death  benefit  is  offered  in  which  the  account  is  credited  with  TRS  and  ERS  employer  contributions  and 
investment income on such funds.  The pre-retirement death benefit (group term life insurance) is paid in addition to the return of 
member contributions upon the death of an active TRS or ERS member who has completed at least one year of active membership 
in the system and whose date of death was within 180 days of such member's last date of actual service.  However, a surviving 
spouse beneficiary of a deceased member who was eligible for service retirement may elect a survivor allowance in lieu of this 
benefit.  The pre-retirement death benefit is equal to the annual earnable compensation of the member as reported to the system for 
the preceding year ending June 30, for TRS and September 30, for ERS.  There is no pre-retirement death benefit available for JRF 
members. 
 
When  a  member  withdraws  from  service  prior  to  becoming  vested,  the  member's  accumulated  contributions  and  a  portion  of 
accumulated interest credited to the Annuity Savings account are returned to the member.  The portion of accumulated interest, 
which by law is not payable to the member, is transferred to the Expense Fund. 
 
RSA issued a stand-alone financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information (including the 
six-year trend) for the year ended September 30, 2010.  Copies may be obtained by writing to:

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a. Basis of Accounting 
The TRS, ERS, and JRF financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.  Contributions are recognized as 
revenues when earned, pursuant to plan requirements. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with requirements of 
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  Under these requirements, the TRS, ERS, and JRF are considered component 
units of the State of Alabama. 

b. Investments 
The Boards of Control of the Systems have the responsibility and authority to invest and reinvest available funds, through the 
Secretary-Treasurer  and  Investment  Committee,  in  bonds,  mortgage-backed  securities,  common  and  preferred  stock,  or  other 
investment  vehicles  with  the  care,  skill,  prudence  and diligence under  the  circumstances  then prevailing  that  a  prudent  person 
acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.  All plan assets are carried at fair value.  Securities traded on 
national or international exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price at current exchange rates.  Short-term investments are 
reported at cost, which approximates fair value.  Mortgage-backed securities are reported based on future principal and interest 
payments discounted at the prevailing interest rate for similar instruments.  The fair value of real estate investments is based on 
independent appraisals. 
 
As of September 30, 2010, the TRS and ERS owned debt and equity securities of Raycom Media Corporation which represented 
approximately  6.15  percent  and  6.86  percent,  respectively,  of  the  TRS  and  ERS  investments  and  Goldman  Sachs  which 
represented approximately 6.63% and 6.06%, respectively, of the TRS and ERS investments. 

3. Contributions Required and Contributions Made 
The actuary has computed, as of the date of the latest available actuarial valuations (September 30, 2009 for TRS, ERS and JRF), 
the estimated present value of benefits payable to retired members, beneficiaries and active members.  The actuarial valuations for 
the TRS and ERS are prepared using the entry age method, while the JRF valuation utilizes the projected unit credit method. The 
present value of all expected benefits payable from each system to the present group of members and beneficiaries is calculated by 
adding  the  present  value  of  the  expected  benefits  payable  to  the  active  members  to  the  present  value  of  the  expected  future 
payments to retired members and beneficiaries. 
 
As required by the Alabama State Law, the TRS, ERS, and JRF provide for employer contributions at actuarially determined rates 
(expressed as percentages of annual covered payroll) that accumulate sufficient assets to pay benefits when due.  The employer 
contributions required to support the benefits of each system are determined following a level funding approach and consist of a 
normal contribution, an accrued liability contribution, and a portion to finance administrative costs. 
 
For  the  TRS  and  ERS,  the  normal  contribution  is  determined  using  the  “entry  age  normal”  method.    Under  this  method,  a 
calculation is made to determine the uniform and constant percentage rate of the employer contributions which, if applied to the 
compensation of the average new member during the entire period of the member's anticipated covered service, would be required 

 

124 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
in addition to the contributions of the member to meet the cost of all benefits payable on the member's behalf. The amortization 
method  is  level  percent  open  for  the  September  30,  2009  actuarial  valuations  for  the  TRS  and  the  ERS.  The  remaining 
amortization period is 30 years for the TRS, ERS-state employees, and ERS-state policemen. 
 
For the JRF, the normal contribution is determined using the “projected accrued benefit” (unit-credit) method.  Under this method, 
the benefits of each individual included in an actuarial valuation are allocated by a consistent formula to valuation years.  The 
actuarial  gains  (losses),  as  they  occur,  generally  reduce  (increase)  the  unfunded  actuarial  accrued  liability.  The  amortization 
method is level percent open for the September 30, 2009 actuarial valuation.  The remaining amortization period is 30 years.  
 
The required contribution rate of active plan members for TRS and ERS (excluding state policemen, and certified firefighters, 
police  officers  and  correctional  officers)  is  5  percent  of  earnable  compensation.  State  policemen  are  required  to  contribute  10 
percent of earnable compensation.   JRF members and certified firefighter, police officer, and correctional officer members of the 
TRS and ERS are required to contribute 6 percent of earnable compensation.  DROP participants continue to contribute during the 
DROP period, but receive a refund of these contributions and a portion of the interest upon retirement. 
 
For fiscal year 2010, the required contribution rate of the employer for ERS (state employees) was 11.94 percent and the rate for 
TRS was 12.51 percent.  The employer contribution rate for ERS state policemen and JRF was 30.57 percent and 24.20 percent, 
respectively.

B. Other Pension Plans 
The State Port Authority administers two single-employer pension plans, the Hourly Plan and the Terminal Railway Plan, for a 
small number of hourly workers and railway employees.  The Peace Officers Annuity and Benefit Fund is a cost-sharing multiple-
employer defined benefit pension plan that provides a small additional pension benefit to state and local peace officers beyond that 
which is paid by the Employees’ Retirement System.  The Clerks and Registers Supernumerary Fund is a cost-sharing multiple-
employer defined benefit pension plan that provides pension benefits to circuit clerks and registrars of courts. These pension plans 
are not material to the State. 

NOTE 8 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
The State offers employees the opportunity to participate in an optional deferred compensation plan created in accordance with 
Internal Revenue Service Code Section 457.  The plan is available to all state employees and permits them to defer a portion of 
their salary until future years.  The current value of the employee contributions may be withdrawn upon termination, retirement, 
death, or an unforeseeable emergency.  
 
It is the opinion of the State's legal counsel that the State has no liability for losses under this plan but does have the duty of due 
care that would be required of an ordinary prudent investor.  
 
The Public Employees' Individual Retirement Account Fund/Deferred Compensation Plan (RSA-1) is administered and operated 
by  its  Board  of  Control.    All  members  of  the  Teachers'  Retirement  System  of  Alabama,  Employees'  Retirement  System  of 

 

126 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Alabama, Judicial Retirement Fund, and employees of employers eligible to participate in the Employees' Retirement System, are 
eligible to participate in this plan.  At September 30, 2010, net assets of the plan totaled $1,332,540,000. 
 
State  employees  may  also  participate  in  a  plan  administered  by  Great-West  Retirement  Services.  This  plan  is  also  a  deferred 
compensation plan organized under IRC Section 457.  The plan contract requires the assets to be held in trust for the benefit of 
plan participants.  The State has no fiduciary responsibility for the assets and therefore does not include the plan in its reporting 
entity.  

NOTE 9 - POSTEMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFITS 
In addition to the pension benefits described in the Retirement Plans note, the State provides postretirement health care benefits, in 
accordance with Code of  Alabama  1975, Section 36-29-10, to all retired state employees through the State Employees' Health 
Insurance  Plan  (SEHIP)  and,  in  accordance  with  Code  of  Alabama  1975, Section  16-25A-17,  to  all  retired  employees  of  state 
educational  institutions  through  the  Public  Education  Employees'  Health  Insurance  Plan  (PEEHIP).  The  retiree  portion  of  the 
SEHIP is accounted for through the Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust and the retiree portion of the PEEHIP is 
accounted for through the Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust (see plan description).  Employees covered under 
these two plans who retire from active service and begin receiving monthly benefits from the Employees' Retirement System of 
Alabama or from the Teachers' Retirement System of Alabama may elect to continue coverage under the group insurance plan by 
consenting to have deducted from their monthly benefit payment the difference in the total cost of their insurance coverage and the 
portion  authorized  to  be  expended  by  the  SEHIP  or  PEEHIP  for  coverage  of  such  retired  employees.    The  State  Employees’ 
Insurance Board administers SEHIP, and the Public Education Employees’ Insurance Board administers PEEHIP. 
  
In order to fund the ongoing costs of these other postemployment benefits (OPEB), the State has established two trust funds as 
described below to comply with GASB Statements 43 and 45.  

A. Plan Descriptions 
The Alabama Retired Education Employees’ Health Care Trust is a multiple employer cost-sharing defined benefit health care 
plan established as an irrevocable trust in 2007 by Constitutional Amendment 798.  As of the latest actuarial evaluation, there were 
192 participating employers. 
 
The Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust is a single employer defined benefit health care plan established as an 
irrevocable trust in 2007 by Constitutional Amendment 798.   
 
The  Public  Education  Employees’  Health  Insurance  Board  issued  a  stand-alone  plan  financial  report  for  the  Alabama  Retired 
Education Employees’ Health Care Trust that includes financial statements and detailed disclosures for the year ended September 
30, 2010.  A copy may be obtained by writing to:

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

1. Basis of Accounting 
Both  Trusts  are  “other  employee  benefits  trust  funds”  that  operate  under  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.    Plan  member 
contributions are recognized in the period in which contributions are due.  Employer contributions are recognized when earned, 
pursuant to plan requirements.  Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the 
plan.   

2. Investments 
All plan assets are carried at fair value except short-term investments which are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.  
Securities  traded  on  national  or  international  exchanges  are  valued  at  the  last  reported  sales  price  at  current  exchange  rates.  
Mortgage-backed securities are reported based on estimated future principal and interest payments discounted at the prevailing 
interest  rate  for  similar  instruments.    Investments  not  traded  on  exchanges  are  valued  based  on  the  selling  price  of  similar 
investments  sold  in  the  open  market.    In  those  instances  where  there  are  no  similar  investments  sold  in  the  open  market,  an 
appraisal is performed to determine the fair value of the investments. 

C.  Funding Policy 
The cost of the teachers’ health care benefits is paid from the regular appropriations made to individual education entities. The 
retired employee allocation is funded through the active employee premium. Retirees who are eligible for Medicare benefits must 
pay $1.14 per month for the Hospital/Medical coverage while those who are not eligible for Medicare must pay $97.54 per month 
for  the  coverage.    Additional  premiums  are  paid  for dependents.    Optionally,  the  retirees  may  use  this  insurance  allocation  to 
purchase two plans of optional insurance offered by PEEHIP with no out-of-pocket cost.  The Medicare Part D subsidy for fiscal 
year 2010 was $27,959,472.  Of this amount, $1,193,738 was an on-behalf payment for the primary government of the State of 
Alabama and $949,976 on-behalf payments of the major discretely presented component units of the State of Alabama.  Most of 
the remaining amount was on-behalf payments for local school boards that are not part of the State’s reporting entity. 
 
The State provides health care benefits for retired state employees through SEHIP.  For retirees who retired prior to October 1, 
2005, the State pays 100 percent of the premium for a retiree who is over 65 and eligible for Medicare.  The State pays a portion of 
the premium for a retiree who is under 65.  Under the SEHIP statute, the State contribution per month per retiree is funded on a 
pay-as-you-go basis through the active employee premiums each agency pays for its active employees.  COBRA insurance is also 
available to state employees who terminate state service, but the employee is liable for the premiums.  For retirees, who retire on 
or  after  October  1,  2005  except  for  disability,  Act  2004-648  provides  that  the  State  contribution  for  retiree  health  insurance 
premiums shall be based on years of service.  The State contribution to the health insurance premium shall be reduced by two 
percent for each year of service less than twenty-five and increased by two percent for each year of service over twenty-five.  The 
retiree is responsible for the amount of contribution not covered by the State. Also, the State may make additional contributions.  
Additional funds were not contributed during fiscal year 2010.   The Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy for fiscal year 2010 was 
$6,794,000. 

1. Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation 
Government  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement  No.  45,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  by  Employers  for 
Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions, requires additional reporting and disclosures for OPEB plans. 
 
 The PEEHIP is a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan.  Contribution requirements are determined by statute.  In all instances, the 
state and its discretely presented component units paid 100% of the statutorily determined contribution requirements.  Therefore, 
the State has no net OPEB obligation related to the PEEHIP.

Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events far into 
the future.  Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are 
subject to continual revision as actual results are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future.  The 
schedule of funding progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, 
presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative 
to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 

252.2%

 

3. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions 
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer 
and the plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing 
of  benefit  costs  between  the  employer  and  plan  members  to  that  point.    The  actuarial  methods  and  assumptions  used  include 
techniques that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of 
assets,  consistent  with  the  long-term  perspective  of  the  calculations.      The  actuarial  value  of  assets  was  determined  using 
techniques that spread the effects of short-term volatility in the market value of investments over a five year period.

The assumed investment rate of return reflects the fact that although, as of September 30, 2007, the Plan does not have assets in 
trust solely to provide benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries, a trust has been established along with a policy to make regular 
contributions representing a partial payment toward the ARC each year.  If the Plan starts fully pre-funding benefits, the discount 
rate may be increased to reflect equity investment the fund may have after full pre-funding begins.  This investment rate of return 
assumption is independent of the inflation assumption.

NOTE 10 - RELATED ORGANIZATIONS 
The State's officials are responsible for appointing a majority of the members of the boards of other organizations, but the State's 
accountability for these organizations does not extend beyond making appointments.  The State appoints the nine-member board of 
the Private Colleges and Universities Facilities Authority and a majority of the eleven member board of the Alabama Family Trust 
Corporation. 

NOTE 11 - JOINT VENTURES AND JOINTLY GOVERNED ORGANIZATIONS 

A. Joint Ventures 
The Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority is a joint venture created by a compact executed between the State 
of Alabama and the States of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky.  Its purpose is to develop and promote a navigable waterway 
between the Tennessee and Tombigbee rivers and provide a nine foot deep navigable channel.  The State of Alabama provided 
$119,000 and $135,000 to the Authority for fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2009, respectively.  The fiscal year of the Tennessee-
Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority ends on December 31.  Key financial data for the Authority is shown below.

B. Jointly Governed Organizations 
The Historic Chattahoochee Commission is a jointly governed organization that was created by a compact executed between the 
State of Alabama and the State of Georgia.  The Commission had $339,000 in revenues in 2010.   

NOTE 12 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Montgomery Downtown Redevelopment Authority, a public corporation, issued $65,200,000 of bonds in 1988 to construct 
the Gordon Persons office building.  These bonds were partially refunded in 1992 with a new bond issue of $66,150,000.  The 
Series 1992 bonds were refunded in 2002 with a new bond issue of $43,265,000.  The bonds' final maturity is on October 1, 2013.  
Members of the board of directors of the Authority are appointed by officials of the City of Montgomery, but the Authority is not a 
part of the City's reporting entity and is therefore considered a separate "stand-alone government."  The bonds issued constitute 
conduit debt obligations of the Authority, and are therefore reported as revenue bond debt of the State.  The Authority has also 
issued conduit debt on behalf of other governments and third parties, none of which is reported in these financial statements.  The 
State operates and maintains the building and has entered into an agreement with the Authority whereby the rental payments from 
state agencies occupying the building are paid to the Authority, which then uses the money to pay the bond principal and interest.  
The payments to the Authority are reported by the State as debt principal and interest expenditures. 
 
These  financial  statements  exclude  certain  foundations  and  other  organizations  affiliated  with  state  colleges  and  universities.  
While the purpose of these foundations and associations is to operate exclusively for the benefit of the colleges and universities, 
such organizations do not constitute component units under the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 
Statement No. 14, "The Reporting Entity" and GASB Statement No. 39, an amendment to GASB 14.  These are:  the University of 
Alabama  at  Huntsville  Eminent  Scholar  Foundation,  the  Alabama  Engineering  Foundation,  the  UAH  Alumni  Association,  the 
UAH Athletic Association, the University of South Alabama Medical Science Foundation, the Alabama A & M Foundation, the 
North Alabama Center for Educational Excellence, the Alabama A&M Research Institute, the University of Alabama Birmingham

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
Educational Foundation (UABEF), the University of Alabama Health Services Foundation, P.C. (HSF), the University of Alabama 
Birmingham Health System, and the Valley Foundation. 
 
The UABEF made contributions to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) of $4,365,000 during the 2010 fiscal year.  
UABEF leases certain facilities to UAB with annual rental expense of approximately $1,932,000 for 2010.  
 
An  affiliation  agreement  documents  the  relationship  between  HSF  and  UAB.  The  operating  revenues  of  UAB  include 
approximately $39,668,000 of funding from HSF in 2010, which is used to support the educational and research activities of UAB. 
 
UAB and HSF have entered into an agreement which established a common management group, the UAB Health System.  The 
purpose of this agreement is to provide common management for their existing and future health care delivery operations.  UAB 
contributed $6,313,000 during 2010 to the UAB Health System Board. 
 
The South Alabama Medical Science Foundation exists for the purpose of promoting education and research at the University of 
South Alabama.  The Foundation reimburses the University for certain administrative expenses and other related support services.  
Total amounts received for such expenses were approximately $1,128,000 for 2010. 

 

NOTE 13 - CONTINGENCIES 

A. Grants 
The State receives federal grants for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies.  Entitlement to 
these resources is generally conditional upon compliance with the terms and conditions of grant agreements and applicable federal 
regulations, including the expenditure of resources for allowable purposes. 
 
Federal grantor agencies from time to time review state records to determine whether the State has complied with the terms and 
conditions of grant agreements and federal regulations.  Any disallowance resulting from a federal audit may become a liability of 
the  State  but  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  at  this  time.    It  is  believed  that  any  liability  resulting  from  a  determination  of 
noncompliance will not materially affect the State's financial condition.   

B. Tobacco Settlement 
As a party to a successful multi-state legal settlement with the tobacco industry, the State received $97.2 million in fiscal year 
2010, $116.6 million in fiscal year 2009, $106.1 million in fiscal year 2008, $99.0 million in fiscal year 2007, $94.6 million in 
fiscal year 2006, $101.9 million in fiscal year 2005, $102.6 million in fiscal year 2004, $118.6 million in 2003 and $224.7 million 
in both 2002 and 2001.  This settlement money is intended to compensate the State for smoking related health care costs incurred 
by various state programs.  Because the exact amount of the future settlement amounts is not measurable, no receivable for these 
amounts is recorded in these financial statements. 

C. Litigation 
The State is a party to numerous legal proceedings that occur in the normal course of governmental operations, some of which 
involve  potentially  significant  amounts.    The  lawsuits  involving  potentially  significant  amounts  are  described  below.    Other 
proceedings involving amounts that, when aggregated, have no material effect on the accompanying government-wide financial 
statements, may have an impact on the related individual state agencies and funds.  The monetary impact, if any, of litigation 
resulting  in  adverse  rulings  is  usually  addressed  in  subsequent  state  budgets  and  modifications  of  state  laws.    Due  to  the 
uncertainty involving the ultimate outcome and amounts of the unresolved litigation described below, no provision for potential 
liability has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. 
 
Blaylock, et al. v. American Tobacco Co., et al., filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County is an arbitration proceeding 
concerning  the  Master  Settlement  Agreement  (MSA)  that  was  negotiated  with  the  tobacco  industry  in  1998.    The  MSA  was 
entered  into  as  a  settlement  of  litigation  brought  against  the  participating  tobacco  products  manufacturers  by  the  Attorney  
Generals of the signatory states to reimburse the states for health care expenses in treating their citizens affected by the use of 
tobacco products sold by the manufacturers.  The MSA contains a provision that allows an adjustment to reduce the payments by 

 

132 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the tobacco industry if the MSA has been determined to be a significant factor in the loss of market share by the manufacturers.  
States will not be subject to a reduction in their payments if it is determined that they diligently enforced their escrow statutes.  The 
2003 payment has a potential adjustment of $1.2 billion nationwide that could be applied to the states that are determined not to 
have diligently enforced their escrow statutes during 2003.  The question of whether the state was diligent will be determined by 
an  arbitration  panel  consisting  of  three  retired  Article  III  federal  judges.    The  arbitration  commenced  in  the  fall  of  2010  with 
hearings on preliminary matters and is currently ongoing.  Alabama’s potential share of the adjustment could be as much as $100 
million if Alabama is deemed to have not diligently enforced its escrow statutes during 2003.  The states are attempting to work 
together in the negotiations and they are sharing in the preparations for the arbitration. 
 
In  March  2002  the  Alabama  Public  School  and  College Authority  (the  "Authority") and  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank  ("JPMorgan") 
entered into a series of agreements (collectively, the "Swap Options") in connection with the Authority's Series 1998 Bonds, Series 
1999-A  Bonds,  Series  1999-C  Bonds  and  Series  1999-D  Bonds  (together,  the  "Authority  Bonds").    The  Swap  Options  were 
amended  in  2003.    Under  the  terms  of  the  Swap  Options  the  Authority  received  lump  sum  payments  of  approximately  $12.6 
million, and JPMorgan was granted an option to require the Authority to enter into fixed rate payer swaps in connection with 
variable rate refundings of the Authority Bonds.  JPMorgan gave notice of exercise of the first option in June 2008 and has since 
given notice of the exercise of each of the other options.  From July 2008 through October 2008, prior to the exercise date for the 
first  Swap  Option,  the  Authority  initiated  discussions  with  JPMorgan  about  the  Swap  Options  and  raised  concerns  about  the 
structure and legality of the Swap Options.  In October 2008 the Authority filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district 
court requesting the court to determine the rights and obligations of the parties under the Swap Options.  This case was settled in 
December 2010.  The parties filed a Joint Motion for Voluntary Dismissal and an Order was granted dismissing the case. 
 
Lynch, et al. v. State of Alabama, et al., is a class action filed in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, on March 
13,  2008.    This  class  action suit  is  brought  on  behalf of public  school  students  who maintain  that  their  civil  rights  have  been 
violated by the manner in which Alabama’s public schools are funded.  The plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment that the 
property tax restrictions in the Alabama Constitution violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000d et seq., and 
the  Constitution  of  the  United  States.    They  also  seek  an  injunction  against  enforcing  the  current  property  tax  laws  until  the 
Governor and legislature enact tax reforms and adequate funding of education.  The financial impact is not determinable at this 
time, but is potentially significant.  A trial began in U. S. District Court on March 21, 2011 and is ongoing.  
 
The State of Alabama has been involved in settling lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the franchise tax in effect before 
2000.   The  U.  S. Supreme  Court  ruled  that  Alabama’s  franchise  tax  scheme  unconstitutionally  discriminated  against  interstate 
commerce.    The  State  is  continuing  to  negotiate  settlements  with  corporations  for  potential  refunds  totaling  $87,000,000  plus 
accumulated  interest  of  $150  million  to  $200  million.    The  State  Legislature  enacted  laws  to  remedy  the  significant  loss  of 
revenue.  
 
On August 14, 2009, Colonial Bank failed and was taken over by the State Banking Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.  The State of Alabama Department of Revenue entered final tax assessments totaling $154,600,000 and recorded 
liens  against  various  entities  within  the  Colonial  Bank  family  of  entities.    Appeals  from  those  assessments  are  pending  in  the 
Administrative Law Division of the Department of Revenue, the Montgomery Bankruptcy Court, and in the FDIC receivership in 
Dallas, Texas. 
 
The State of Alabama Department of Revenue is also involved in significant tax-related lawsuits or actions that challenge the 
legality of certain taxes or challenge other provisions of tax laws and procedures.  Other cases challenge tax assessments made by 
the Department.  These cases have a significant combined potential refund liability or reductions of assessments.   Adverse rulings 
in these cases could also reduce future revenues.  
 
Eugene Crum, Jr., et al. v. State of Alabama, et al., was an employment discrimination case filed in 1994 against various state 
agencies and the State Personnel Department.  The Crum case alleges discrimination in all aspects of employment. In March 2006, 
the State filed a request to the Court for a ruling on the class certification issue citing, in part, the continuing financial burden that 
expert updates and responses has placed on the State.  The Court granted the State’s “Motion for a Ruling” in May 2006.  The 
Court  recently  denied  class  certification  to  plaintiffs  and  defendants.    Any  individual  lawsuits  remaining  are  not  considered  a 
significant liability to the state.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
NOTE 14 -  DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENTS 
The Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, as adopted in Alabama, permits the boards of the educational institutions of 
the  State  to  allocate  an  amount  of  realized  and  unrealized  endowment  appreciation  as  the  boards  determine  to  be  prudent  for 
donor-restricted endowments.  The colleges’ policies are to retain the endowments realized and unrealized appreciation with the 
endowments after the spending rate distributions.  Endowments’ earnings are classified in accordance with donor restrictions and 
are reported in the component units as net assets restricted for permanent trust – expendable or non-expendable as appropriate.  
The Boards of the University of Alabama and University of South Alabama approved a spending rate of 5% of a moving three-
year average of the fair (unit) value. The other four-year colleges have approved similar spending rate policies with rates ranging 
between 3 and 6%.  The net endowment appreciation of the four-year colleges at September 30, 2010 was $45,714,000.  

NOTE 15 -  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
Primary Government 
 
On December 9, 2010, the Alabama State Port Authority issued $106,045,000 Series 2010 Docks Facilities Revenue Bonds.  The 
interest  rates  on  the  bond  range  from  6%  to  6.25%  and  will  mature  on  October  1,  2040.    The  bonds  refund  the  outstanding 
$79,298,000 of the 2008-B and 2009-A debt. 
 
In November, 2010, Athens State University, a subsidiary of the Alabama College System, executed a private placement bond 
issue in the amount of $1,860,000 to purchase a strip mall located adjacent to campus.   
 
 
Component Units 
 
From October 1, 2010 through December 17, 2010, the Alabama Housing Finance Authority called approximately $30,960,000 of 
bonds prior to their scheduled maturities in the single family bond program.   
 
The Housing Finance Agency Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) is funded through the U.S. Department of Treasury to provide funds to help 
families  in  states  hit  hardest  by  the  foreclosure  crisis  in  conjunction  with  high  unemployment  rates.    Alabama,  through  the 
Alabama Housing Finance Authority, was added in the third round of potential funding in August 2010.  In September 2010, the 
Authority submitted a proposal for $60.6 million of HHF funds.  Subsequently, additional funds totaling $101.9 million were made 
available  to  the  State  of  Alabama  to  be  administered  by the  Authority.  After  initiating  a  pilot program  in  December  2010  the 
program  is  scheduled  to  begin  in  February  2011.  The  Authority  is  currently  designing  and  planning  its  implementation.  The 
Authority has drawn $8 million in HHF funds to be used to fund the program as of the date the financial statements were available 
to be issued. 
 
Subsequent  to  year-end,  Moody's  Investor  Services  downgraded  Pallas  Capital  Corporation’s  guaranteed  investment  contracts 
(GICs) below the Alabama Housing Finance Authority’s contractual requirements.  All amounts relating to Pallas’ GICs have been 
sold and reinvested in money market funds, within each respective single-family bond issue. 
 
On November 9, 2010, the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa issued the Series 2010 B, C, and D General Revenue Bonds 
totaling $149,460,000.  The proceeds from these bond issuances will fund various capital projects. 
 
In November, 2010, the University of Alabama at Birmingham issued $54,650,000 Series 2010A General Revenue Bonds.  The 
bonds pay interest at varying rates 2% to 4.25% with principal due annually through October 1, 2034.  In November, 2010, the 
University issued $52,975,000 In Series 2010B General Revenue Bonds.  The bonds pay interest at varying rates 1% to 5.2% with 
principal due annually through October 1, 2030.  In November, 2010, the University issued $34,550,000 in Series 2010C General 
Revenue Bonds.  The bonds pay interest at varying rates 2% to 4% with principal due annually through October 1, 2027.   
 
In November, 2010, the Alabama Public School and College Authority issued $53,000,000 Series 2010-C Tax-Exempt Capital 
Improvement Direct Loan Bonds and $13,500,000 Series 2010-D Taxable Capital Improvement Direct Loan Bonds.  The interest 
rates on the 2010-C and 2010-D bonds range from 2.48% to 3.77%.  The bonds will be payable on December 1 each year.  The 
maturity date of the bonds is December 1, 2020.

On November 30, 2010, the Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority issued $36,850,000 Series 2010-C Revolving Fund Loan 
Refunding Bonds.  The interest rates on the bonds range from 2% to 4% and the bonds will mature on August 15, 2023.  The 
bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding, on a current basis, $61,795,000 Series 2000 bonds. 
 
On December 20, 2010, the Declaratory Judgment Action from 2008 in regard to the March 2002 interest swap agreement along 
with the 2003 amendments between Alabama Public School and College Authority and JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., was settled.  
The Authority made a payment to JP Morgan of $19,000,000 in return for a full settlement of claims and mutual release from the 
swap agreement. 
 
On October 29, 2010, the Alabama Higher Education Loan Corporation (AHELC), a nonmajor component unit, paid in full at par 
plus accumulated interest $75,100,000 Series 2006-A1 and Series 2006-A2 bonds.  The Health Care and Education Reconciliation 
Act (HCERA) of 2010 was signed into law on March 30, 2010.  HCERA eliminates the origination and/or guarantee of FFELP 
loans, effective July 1, 2010.  HCERA does allow lenders to make subsequent disbursements on loans originated on or before June 
30, 2010.  Since the Corporation cannot fund any new FFELP loans after June 30, 2010, a strategic decision was made to sell the 
entire  FFELP  Loan  Portfolio  and  utilize  the  proceeds  of  that  sale  and  additional  equity  to  redeem  its  outstanding  bonds  and 
eliminate  all  of  the  Corporation’s  debt.    The  loan  portfolio  was  offered  for  sale  through  a  competitively  bid  transaction.    On 
October  19,  2010,  the  loans  were  sold  to  a  reputable  lender  and  servicer  of  FFELP  loans  who  also  agreed  as  a  part  of  the 
transaction to honor all of the AHELC borrower benefits that were attached to the loans. 
 
On November 17, 2010, the Alabama Revolving Loan Fund Authority issued $20,755,000 Series 2010 Special Obligation and 
Refunding Taxable Bonds.  The interest rate on the bond ranges from 2.5% to 6% with principal due annually on March 1.  The 
maturity date of the bonds is March 1, 2030.  The bonds will refund $8,330,000 Series 2000 bonds. 
 
Subsequent to September 30, 2010, the University of North Alabama refinanced $10,355,000 of the 1999-A General Fee Revenue 
Bonds and issued new debt in the amount of $25,290,000 in Build America Bonds for the purpose of constructing a Science and 
Engineering Technology Facility.

Budgetary Process 

Formulation of the budget begins with the preparation of estimates of expenditure requirements for the next fiscal year by the 
administrative  head of each budgeted agency and institution.  These estimates are submitted annually to the Executive Budget 
Office of the Finance Department on or before the first day of the third month preceding each regular session of the Legislature.  
The budget is prepared by program elements for each agency.  Requested changes in programmatic expenditures over the prior 
fiscal year must be explained, and proposed capital expenditures must be justified as required by the Executive Budget Office. 
 
The  budget  document,  as  finally  developed  by  the  Governor,  is  published  and  transmitted  to  the  Legislature  on  or  before  the 
second  legislative  day  of  each  regular  session.    For  each  agency,  comparative  summaries  of  appropriations  and  revenues  are 
presented for the prior year, current year, the agency's request for the next year, and the Governor's recommendation for the next 
year.  The recommended appropriation bills indicate the programmatic appropriation to each agency and the source of funds from 
which each appropriation is to be paid.  The Legislature then legally enacts the State budget into law through the passage of a 
number of bills as Appropriation Acts.  Some conditional appropriations are included in the Appropriation Acts.  The agencies do 
not include these conditional amounts in the original budget, unless the conditions have been met before the fiscal year begins.  
 
The  General  Fund  appropriations  were  reduced  as  a  result  of  proration  in  the  amount  of  $184  million  and  then  proration  was 
reduced by $31 million later for a net proration of $153 million.  Approximately $101 million of supplemental appropriations and 
$3 million of conditional and other appropriations were distributed to various agencies from the General Fund.  The Department of 
Corrections  and  the  Medicaid  Agency  received  supplemental  appropriations  in  the  amounts  of  $52  million  and  $42  million, 
respectively.  Some expenditures are required by law to be fully funded and estimated amounts are approved in the General Fund 
appropriation  bill.    Increases  to  these  estimated  amounts  do  not  require  a  new  bill  and  are  included  as  other  appropriations. 
Original  appropriations  to  the  Departmental  Emergency  Fund  are  included  in  the  original  budget.  Emergency  appropriations 
cannot exceed two percent of the total General Fund appropriation bill.  
 
The Education Trust Fund appropriations were reduced twice as a result of proration in the amounts of $428 million and $114 
million.  During  fiscal  year  2010,  $20  million  of  supplemental  appropriations  were  distributed  from  the  Education  Trust  Fund.  
Veterans Affairs received a supplemental appropriation of $14 million.   
 
The Appropriation Acts budget by agency and program rather than by GAAP basis funds.  The State funds its budgetary activities 
under three budgetary fund groups.  The first is the General Fund, which includes many of the general operations of the three 
branches of government.  The second is the Education Trust Fund (ETF), which is restricted to funding all levels of educational 
activity in the State.  The third budgetary group is referred to in the budget documents as Earmarked Funds.  The Earmarked Funds 
group includes the operations of most governmental funds of both the primary government and the component units, as well as 
portions of some proprietary and fiduciary operations.   
 
The  Appropriation  Acts  do  not  include  a  revenue  budget.    At  the  time  of  their  passage,  estimates  prepared  by  legislative  and 
executive  branch  professional  staff  assure  the  legislature  that  adequate  revenues  will  be  available  to  meet  the  level  of 
appropriations  approved.    The  Appropriation  Acts  specify  that  in  addition  to  the  appropriations  made,  all  gifts,  grants,  or 
contributions in excess of the amount appropriated are automatically appropriated to be used for the purposes specified in the gift, 
grant, or contribution.  This includes federal funds which are included in the Earmarked Funds.  Most of the $3.4 billion increase 
in the Earmarked Funds is increased federal funds. 
 
Numerous statutes exist which restrict the use of most state revenue sources to specific uses.  The General Fund is funded by a 
wide variety of taxes, licenses, and interest income.  The ETF is funded primarily by income taxes and sales taxes.  The Earmarked 
Funds are generally funded by a combination of federal funds, local funds, and specific taxes and licenses. State law also requires 
that if revenues actually received are inadequate to fund the appropriations, then the appropriations must be prorated to the level 
that the revenues will support.  For the Budgetary Comparison Schedule, the budgeted revenues consist of the amount of budgeted 
expenditures allocated among the revenue categories in proportion to the actual amounts received.

Budgetary Control 

The legal level of control is the agency and program specified in the Appropriation Acts.  For example, “Lab Analysis and Disease 
Control” and “Agricultural Inspection Services” are two programs within the agency of Agriculture and Industries.  Below this 
legal  level  of  control,  the  professional  management  of  the  Finance  Department,  under  the  authority  of  the  Governor’s  policy, 
exercises  budgetary  control  at  the  fund  and  object  level.    Each  agency  must  submit  an  operations  plan  detailing  planned 
expenditures down to the object level, and then must follow that plan or explain why a change must be made.  Allotments of 
appropriations are made quarterly based on the plans of operations submitted by the agencies.    
 
The  Department  of  Finance  enforces  both  the  legal  level  and  the  professional  management  level  of  budgetary  control  through 
automated edits which must be complied with before making expenditures against an appropriation.  A change between objects 
within appropriations for programs (financial management level) must have the approval of the Budget Officer and the Finance 
Director. 
 
The  Budget  Management  Act  legally  authorizes  the  transfer  of  appropriations  between  programs  within  an  agency  with  the 
approval  of  the  Governor.    Any  transfers  approved  by  the  Governor  must  be  reported  to  the  Legislature.    Transfers  between 
agencies,  but  within  the  same  program,  may  be  made  pursuant  to  interagency  agreements  executed  for  the  purposes  of 
accomplishing  the  objectives  for  which  the  Legislature  made  the  appropriation.    These  interagency  agreements  must  also  be 
approved by the Governor.  Under the Budget Management Act, the Governor cannot create new budget authority; he can only 
transfer existing authority. 
 
Both the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 and the statutes require a balanced budget for annual financial operations.  The Finance 
Department  monitors  revenue  projections  during  the  year  to  ensure  that  adequate  funds  will  be  available  to  meet  budgeted 
expenditures.  If cash collections do not meet budget projections, the Governor is required to prorate appropriations and restrict 
allotments to prevent an overdraft or budget deficit in any fiscal year. Within the Alabama Trust Fund, a General Fund Rainy Day 
Account  and  an  Education  Trust  Fund  Rainy  Day  Account  have  been  created  by  constitutional  amendment.    If  proration  is 
declared for the General Fund or the Education Trust Fund, then oil and gas capital payments in the Alabama Trust Fund will be 
used to fund withdrawals from the Rainy Day Accounts.  If proration is declared for the General Fund, Rainy Day withdrawals 
may not exceed the lesser of (a) ten percent of the previous fiscal year’s General Fund appropriations less the total amount of any 
prior years’ withdrawals from the account which have not been repaid to the account, or (b) the average of the estimated available 
revenue for the General Fund certified by the Finance Director and the Legislative Fiscal Officer prior to the third legislative day 
of the Regular Session.   If proration is declared for the Education Trust Fund, Rainy Day withdrawals may not exceed the lesser 
of (a) six and one-half percent of the previous fiscal year’s Education Trust Fund appropriations less the total amount of any prior 
years’  withdrawals  from  the  account  which  have  not  been  repaid  to  the  account,  or  (b)  the  average  of  the  estimated  available 
revenue  for  the  Education  Trust  Fund  certified  by  the  Finance  Director  and  the  Legislative  Fiscal  Officer  prior  to  the  third 
legislative  day  of  the  Regular  Session.  The  Rainy  Day  Accounts  must  be  replenished  within  10  years  for  the  General  Fund 
withdrawals and 6 years for the Education Trust Fund withdrawals.  The General Fund was prorated by 12% and then reduced by 
2% in 2010. The Education Trust Fund was prorated by 7.5% and then by an additional 2% in 2010.  The General Fund has 10 
years to pay back $162 million which was withdrawn in 2010, and the Education Trust Fund has 5 years to pay back $437 million 
which was withdrawn in 2009.  At the end of fiscal year 2010 there were no funds left that could be drawn for either Rainy Day 
Accounts. 

Encumbrance Accounting 

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods and services.  Encumbrance accounting is used 
as purchase orders are issued to ensure that purchase orders plus expenditures do not exceed allotment balances.  At fiscal year end 
this  control  becomes  stricter,  as  purchase  orders  plus  any  other  obligations  or  accounts  payable  incurred  against  fiscal  year 
appropriations may not exceed allotment balances. 
 
Encumbrances outstanding at year end in governmental funds are reported on the GAAP basis statements as a reservation of fund 
balance.  Encumbrance balances are reported on the budgetary basis statements as expenditures. 

Lapsing of Appropriations 

All non-capital outlay appropriation balances not reserved by encumbrances or accounts payable lapse at September 30 of each 
fiscal  year.    Furthermore,  any  non-capital  outlay  appropriation  balance  not  reserved  by  encumbrances  lapses  at  November  30 
following each fiscal year.  Encumbrances remain valid for a period of one year following the end of the fiscal year.  Balances of

REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
Notes on Budgetary Accounting and Reporting 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 
encumbrances are reported on the Budgetary Comparison Schedule as expenditures.  Capital outlay appropriations for the purchase 
of land, the construction of buildings, or for the maintenance of roads and bridges of the state highway system continue until the 
completion of the project.  
 

Budgetary Basis of Accounting and Fund Structure 

The  State  budgets  and  operates  primarily  on  the  budgetary  basis  which  approximates  the  cash  basis  with  certain  material 
exceptions.    During  the  fiscal  year,  encumbrances,  which  represent  obligations  against  current  fiscal  year  appropriations,  are 
accrued.    At  year  end,  fund  balances  are  reserved  to  accrue  expenditures  for  those  outstanding  encumbrances  and  estimated 
accounts  payable.    In  compliance  with  Amendment  26  to  the  Constitution  of  Alabama  of  1901,  the  total  reservation  may  not 
exceed the cash on hand in the State Treasury.  Therefore, at year end, cash always equals or exceeds obligations (encumbrances 
and estimated accounts payable). The Budgetary Comparison Schedule (Non-GAAP Basis) presents comparisons of the adopted 
budget with actual data on a budgetary basis.  The budget excludes funds for all entities operating outside the State Treasury, 
certain distributive accounts such as those for making distributions to local governments, and most debt service accounts.  Since 
the accounting principles used in the State’s budgetary basis of accounting differ significantly from those used to present financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP, a reconciliation of the differences is presented on the schedule.  Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 41 requires that budgetary comparison schedules be presented as RSI based on the fund, 
organization,  or  program  structure  that  the  government  uses  for  its  legally  adopted  budget  for  a  government  with  significant 
budgetary perspective differences that result in the government’s not being able to present budgetary comparisons for the general 
fund and each major special revenue fund.  The budgetary fund structure for the General Fund group and the Education Trust Fund 
group is essentially the same as the GAAP fund structure. The Earmarked Fund group does not correspond to a major GAAP fund 
and these perspective differences are included in the Budget-to-GAAP Reconciliation. The budgets of some major funds are spread 
throughout various agencies and programs in the Earmarked Fund group.  A Detail Schedule of Budget and Actual Expenditures 
appears in the Governmental Funds subsection of the Combining and Individual Fund Statements and Schedules Section of the 
CAFR.  This schedule provides detail information at the legal level of control for each individual appropriation item contained in 
the budget for all budgetary fund groups.

Ten Year Loss Development Information for State Insurance Fund 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 

The following table illustrates how the State Insurance Fund's (Fund) earned revenue (net of reinsurance) and investment income 
compare to related costs of loss (net of loss assumed by reinsurers) and other expenses assumed by the Fund as of the end of each 
of the previous ten years. The rows of the table are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's gross 
earned premiums and reported investment revenue, amounts of premiums ceded, and reported premiums (net of reinsurance) and 
reported investment revenue. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operating costs of the Fund including overhead and loss 
adjustment expenses not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the Fund's gross incurred losses and allocated loss 
adjustment expense, losses assumed by reinsurers, and net incurred losses and loss adjustment expense (both paid and accrued) as 
originally  reported  at  the  end  of  the  year  in  which  the  event  that  triggered  coverage  occurred  (called  accident  year).  (4)  This 
section of ten rows shows the cumulative net amounts paid as of the end of successive years for each accident year. (5) This line 
shows the latest reestimated amount of losses assumed by reinsurers for each accident year. (6) This section of ten rows shows 
how each accident year's net incurred losses increased or decreased as of the end of successive years. (This annual reestimation 
results from new information received on known losses, reevaluation of existing information on known losses, and emergence of 
new  losses  not  previously  known.)  (7)  This  line  compares  the  latest  reestimated  net  incurred  losses  amount  to  the  amount 
originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of losses is greater or less than originally estimated. As data 
for  individual accident  years  mature,  the  correlation between original estimates  and  reestimated  amounts  is  commonly  used  to 
evaluate the accuracy of net incurred losses currently recognized in less mature accident years. The columns of the table show data 
for successive accident years.

The medical cost trend rate for Medicare-eligible retirees was changed from 9.5 percent to 9 percent for the 9/30/2008 valuation 
and  for  Pre-Medicare  retirees  was  changed  from  12  percent  to  11  percent  for  the  9/30/2007  valuation.  The  investment  rate  of 
return  was  changed  from  4  percent  to  5  percent  and  the  ultimate  trend  rate  was  changed  from  6  percent  to  5  percent  for  the 
9/30/2006 valuation.  Also, a Medicare Advantage Plan was established for Medicare-eligible retirees.  The medical cost trend rate 
for  pre-Medicare  changed  from  11%  to  10.5%  for  the  9/30/2009  valuation.    The  effects  of  these  changes  are  reflected  in  the 
actuarial valuations.

Information About Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach 
 
For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 
 

Modified Approach 

As  allowed  by  GASB  Statement  Number  34,  the  State  has  adopted  the  modified  approach  for  reporting  roadway  and  bridge 
infrastructure assets.  Under the modified approach, depreciation is not recorded.  Infrastructure costs that result in an increase in 
the capacity or an improvement in the efficiency of the infrastructure network are capitalized and added to the historical cost of the 
assets.  Costs that allow the infrastructure network to be used efficiently over the expected useful life of the assets are expensed as 
general  maintenance  costs.    Certain  maintenance  costs  that  extend  the  useful  life  of  the  assets  but  do  not  increase  capacity  or 
efficiency are classified as preservation costs.  Preservation costs are expensed and reported in lieu of a charge for depreciation 
expense.    Assets  accounted  for  under  the  modified  approach  in  fiscal  year  2010  include  approximately  10,876  miles  of  state 
maintained highways and 5,368 of state maintained bridges and culverts. 
 
In order to utilize the modified approach, Alabama is required to: 

  Maintain an asset management system that includes an inventory of eligible infrastructure assets. 
  Perform condition assessments of eligible assets and summarize the results using a measurement scale. 
  Estimate annually the amount to maintain and preserve the assets at the condition level established and disclosed by the 

State. 

  Document that the assets are being preserved approximately at or above the established condition level. 
 

Roads 

Measurement Scale 
The  Alabama  Department  of  Transportation  uses  the  International  Roughness  Index  (IRI)  to  measure  and  monitor  pavement 
conditions.  The IRI is a standard representing the perceived smoothness of pavements while traveling in passenger cars.  The 
smoothness is measured by the cumulative height the wheel of a vehicle travels vertically over a mile long section of roadway.  
For example, if the wheel of a vehicle travels vertically 1.0 inches every 0.01 miles, the IRI for that 1 mile section of roadway 
would be the sum of 100 measurements (0.01 X 100 = 1 mile)  of 1.0 inches each or 100 inches/mile.  A lower IRI measurement 
represents a smoother condition of pavement.   
 
Data  is  collected  by  route  samples  and  complete  route  assessments  when  available.    If  data  is  collected  in  route  samples,  the 
samples  are  weighted  by  route  length  to  give  system  averages.    If  data  is  collected  for  the  complete  route,  the  frequency  of 
collection is every 0.01 mile and no weighting is used in the computation of system averages.   
 
The United States Department of Transportation developed suggested values for IRI of <60 inches/mile to >220 inches/mile to 
grade the smoothness condition of the roadway.  The Alabama Department of Transportation utilizes this scale of suggested values 
in its roadway condition assessments.  The IRI scale is as follows: 
 
IRI Rating

> 220 Other Routes

Bridges 

Measurement Scale 
ALDOT uses a weighted rating of the major structure components and the deck area of a bridge or culvert.  The GASB 34 Bridge 
Rating is a zero to ten score assigned to each component-rating category and then averaged for each bridge asset classification 
using an algorithm developed by the ALDOT Maintenance Bureau.  The algorithm uses the assessed weighted ratings, each bridge 
deck area, and the sum of all deck areas.  The ten point scale is as follows: 
 
Rating
1 - 4.99
5 - 6.99
7 or Greater

Description
Structural elements have been seriously affected by deterioration.
Structural elements are sound but have minor deterioration.
Structural elements show negligible signs of deterioration.

In fiscal years 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the State estimated it would need to spend $306.0, $310.0, $320.0, $277.7, and 
$247.1 million, respectively, to preserve and maintain all roadway assets and $10.0 million in each year to preserve all bridge 
assets at or above the “Established Condition Levels” presented above. The State spent $387,793,000 for roadway preservation and 
$47,020.000 for bridge preservation in fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2009, the State spent $316,082,000 for road preservation and 
$34,457,000 for bridge preservation.  In fiscal year 2008, the State spent $265,160,000 for roadway preservation and $22,434,000 
for  bridge  preservation.  In  fiscal  year  2007,  the  State  spent  $293,253,000  for  roadway  preservation  and  $2,188,000  for  bridge 
preservation.  In fiscal year 2006, the State spent $259,823,000 for maintenance and preservation of roadway and bridge assets 
combined.  In the next fiscal year, the Alabama Department of Transportation estimates that it will need to spend approximately 
$319,568,000  to  preserve  all  roadway  assets  and  approximately  $10,000,000  to  preserve  all  bridge  assets  at  or  above  the 
“Established Condition Levels” presented above.  Condition levels are expected to continue to meet or exceed the “Established 
Condition Levels”.

Agency Funds

Agency Funds report assets held by the State in a purely custodial capacity (assets equal liabilities).  Agency funds typically 
involve the receipt, temporary investment, and remittance of resources to individuals, organizations or other governments.

  
 State Clearing Accounts
 Accounts for the collection and distribution of State taxes and licenses as well as amounts collected and held by courts for 
individuals.
  
 Taxes Collected for Local Governments
 Accounts for local taxes which are collected by the State as a service for local governments.  These taxes do not represent 
future revenues of the State.
  
 Payroll
 Accounts for amounts withheld from employees that are not yet distributed to outside organizations or governments.
  
 Other Agency Funds
 Are aggregated for financial reporting purposes and represent amounts held for child support payments, cash bonds, and 
numerous other amounts held for individuals and organizations outside of State government.
